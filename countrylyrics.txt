Hey baby is that you
Wow your hair got so long
Yeah yeah I love it I really do
“Norma Jean” ain't that the song we'd sing
In the car driving downtown
Top down making the rounds
Checking out the bands on Doheny Avenue

Yeah life throws you curves
But you learned to swerve
Me I swung and I missed
And the next thing you know I'm reminiscing
Dreaming old dreams
Wishing old wishes
Like you would be back again

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job guess not much has changed
Punch the clock head for home check the phone just in case
Go to bed dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days
Yeah that's what I'm doing

Someone told me after college
You ran off to Vegas
You married a rodeo cowboy
Wow that ain't the girl I knew
Me I've been a few places
Mostly here and there once or twice
Still sorting out life but I'm doing alright
Yeah it's good to see you too

Well hey girl you're late
And those planes they don't wait
But if you ever come back around
This sleepy old town
Promise me you'll stop in
To see an old friend
And until then

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job guess not much has changed
Punch the clock head for home check the phone just in case
Go to bed dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days

These days
 
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job guess not much has changed
Punch the clock head for home check the phone just in case
Go to bed dream of you
That's what I'm doing these

I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I wake up in teardrops that fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then

I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason I know
I didn't read between the lines
And baby I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right



So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this a part of you
And now it's all too late so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything



So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You feel like a candle in a hurricane
Just like a picture with a broken frame
Alone and helpless
Like you've lost your fight
But you'll be alright you'll be alright


'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad you get strong
Wipe your hands shake it off
Then you stand
Then you stand

Life's like a novel
With the end ripped out
The edge of a canyon
With only one way down
Take what you're given before it's gone
And start holding on keep holding on


'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad you get strong
Wipe your hands shake it off
Then you stand
Yeah then you stand

Every time you get up
And get back in the race
One more small piece of you
Starts to fall into place
Oh



Yeah then you stand
Yeah yeah baby
Woo hoo woo hoo woo hoo

Then you stand yeah yeah

It ain't complicated
Well I've grown to hate it
I never liked the taste of crow but baby I ate it
They tried to warn me
They said that you were ornery
So don't bring me those big brown eyes and tell me that you're sorry
Well you might as well throw gasoline on a fire
The way you lie

You lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
Well You lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well You lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie

That ain't my perfume
I bet she had a curfew
You told me you were out with the boys and baby I believed you
So why you lookin' so nervous
You know you're gonna deserve this
I oughta kill you right now and do the whole wide world a service
Well my daddy's gonna straighten you out like a piece of wire like a piece of wire
The way you lie

You lie like the man with the slick back hair who sold me that Ford
Well You lie like the pine tree in the back yard after last month's storm
Well You lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie

Well I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna drive to the big ol' muddy river
I'm gonna park my car in the middle of the mile-long bridge
And then I'm not gonna cry well maybe just a little
Then I'm gonna slip off the ring that you put on my finger
Give it a big ol' fling and watch it sink
Down down down
And there it's gonna lie
Until the Lord comes back around

Because you lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
Well You lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well You lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes so dang natural to you
The way you lie
The way you lie
Well it's what you do it's who you are

To the teller down at the bank
You're just another checking account
To the plumber that came today
You're just another house
At the airport ticket counter
You're just another fare
At the beauty shop at the mall
Well you're just another head of hair
Well that's alright that's ok
If you don't feel important honey
All I've got to say is


To the world
You may be just another girl
But to me 
Baby you are the world

To the waiter at the restaurant
You're just another tip
To the guy at the ice cream shop
You're just another dip
When you can't get reservations
'Cause you don't have the clout
Or you didn't get an invitation
'Cause somebody left you out
That's alright that's ok
When you don't feel important honey
All I've got to say is



You think you're one of millions but you're one in a million to me
When you wonder if you matter baby look into my eyes
And tell me can't you see you're everything to me

That's alright that's ok
When you don't feel important honey
All I've gotta say is



I wanna lie on my bed and do nothing
I don't care what anyone says
I got you on my mind thinking 'bout one thing
Gonna show you how I do it best

Put my lips on your mouth
Keep you coming around
Cause I like it yeah
Put your hands on my hips
Take me down sink this ship
Boy I can't resist

I wanna wear my hair up in a mess
Cut off jeans can you get with that
Give you something like you never had
Cause I only want to be wanted by you
I wanna tease you 'till you're begging me
And you're on your knees and it's hard to breathe
And every other time's just a memory
Cause I only want to be wanted by you

Those other guys when they call
I might answer {I might answer}
But you're the one I'm thinking 'bout
So baby don't disappoint
Just move faster {just move faster}
And show me what you're feeling now

Put my lips on your mouth
Keep you coming around
Cause I like it yeah
Nothing's wrong it's alright
Got permission from me tonight
So turn off the lights {turn off the lights}

I wanna wear my hair up in a mess
Cut off jeans can you get with that
Give you something like you never had
Cause I only want to be wanted by you
I wanna tease you 'till you're begging me
And you're on your knees and it's hard to breathe
And every other time's just a memory
Cause I only want to be wanted by you

Now I'm going crazy
I'm tired of waiting
My lips are on fire
I just want you to know
I'm losing my patience
For the time that you've wasted

Put your lips on my mouth
Put your lips on my mouth
Put your lips on my

I wanna wear my hair up in a mess
Cut off jeans can you get with that
Give you something like you never had
Cause I only want to be wanted by you

And you're on your knees and it's hard to breathe
And every other time's just a memory
Cause I only want to be wanted by you

Cut off jeans can you get with that
Give you something like you never had
Cause I only want to be wanted by you
I wanna tease you 'till you're begging me
And you're on your knees and it's hard to breathe
And every other time's just a memory
Cause I only want to be wanted by you

Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hangin' off her hips
Eyes sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Homemade jar o' lemon drop take a sip
Don't stop girl you know I love it when you get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on - shine on

Baby get your shine on

Silverado candy painted
Ray Bans got the whole world shaded
Chrome piece tucked in the console
Riding high roll up on the down low
Feeling lucky got hooked up with some Kentucky clear
So slide that little sugar shaker over here
And get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on - shine on

Baby get your shine on

Homemade jar o' lemon drop take a sip
Don't stop girl you know I love it when you get your shine on
'Cause you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on - shine on

Baby get your shine on

Cause you and me be rocking all night long

Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on - shine on

Baby get your shine on

Baby get your shine on

Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hanging off her hips
Eyes sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Silverado candy painted
Ray Bans got the whole world shaded
Chrome piece tucked in the console
Riding high roll up on the down low

Baby get your shine on

No I've not seen you this way before
Standin' a mess at my door
Well it took you so long
But you finally found
You're no one 'til someone lets you down

You believed that all people were kind
And that you'd never mess with your mind
You gave her your trust
And she busted your crown
You're no one 'til someone lets you down

Yes I've been told
That some people grow old
Without losing a part of their soul
But if that is true
I don't wish it on you
There's so much to adore in a heart that is blue

There's a light in your eyes that is pure
That you won't give away anymore
But just think of the things
We can talk about now
You're no one 'til someone lets you down

Yes I have heard
There are some who avoid
All the pain that will come with the fall
But if that's the case
It would surely erase
All the joy that you feel
When the hurt fades away

There's a heart ticket train on the way
Waitin' to take you away
Will you please keep in mind
When it pulls into town
You're no one 'til someone lets you down
You're no one 'til someone lets you down
You're no one 'til someone lets you down

Give me my badge and gun
Give me the road that I may run
Give me that peaceful wandering free I used to know
I've waited all I can
But I'm just not a patient man
Man I've been hiding here for seven months or so

Hand me down my coat and hat
And grab the winter one at that
You never know how long I'll be away

Give me my badge and gun
Give me the songs that I once sung
Give me those jet black kick-back lay-down nights alone
This house is safe and warm
But I was made to chase the storm
Taking the whole world on with big ol' empty arms

Tell my friends I tried my best
That one day I just up and left
They probably saw it coming anyway What can I say
Hey hey

The lock is on the cellar door
I can't remember what it's for
I ain't been down those stairs in oh so long
So so long

Give me my badge and gun
Give me the road that I must run
Give me that peaceful wandering free I used to know
The copy of your key
Is hanging where it used to be
Good as you've always been to me
The life I need to lead
Is somewhere out there calling over those hills


There's a place in your heart where nobody's been
Take me there
Things nobody knows not even your friends
Take me there
Tell me about your momma your daddy your home town show me around
I wanna see it all don't leave anything out


I wanna know everything about you
And I wanna go down every road you've been
Where your hopes and dreams and wishes live where you keep the rest of your life hid
I wanna know the girl behind that pretty stare
Take me there


Your first real kiss your first true love you were scared
Show me where
You learned about life spent your summer nights without a care
Take me there
I wanna roll down mainstreet and backroads like you did when you were a kid
What makes you who you are tell me what your story is


I wanna know everything about you
And I wanna go down every road you've been
Where your hopes and dreams and wishes live where you keep the rest of your life hid
I wanna know the girl behind that pretty stare
Take me there

I wanna roll down mainstreet
I wanna know your hopes and your dreams
Take me take me there
Yeah

If you save yourself for marriage
You're a bore
If you don't save yourself for marriage
You're a whore-able person
If you won't have a drink
Then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk
As soon as you down the first one

If you can't lose the weight
Then you're just fat
But if you lose too much
Then you're on crack
You're damned if you do
And you're damned if you don't
So you might as well just do
Whatever you want
So

Make lots of noise
Kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's something you're into
When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint or don't
Just follow your arrow
Wherever it points yeah
Follow your arrow
Wherever it points

If you don't go to church
You'll go to hell
If you're the first one
On the front row
You're self-righteous
Son of a-
Can't win for losing
You'll just disappoint 'em
Just 'cause you can't beat 'em
Don't mean you should join 'em

So make lots of noise
Kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's something you're into
When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint or don't
Just follow your arrow
Wherever it points yeah
Follow your arrow
Wherever it points

Say what you think
Love who you love
'Cause you just get
So many trips 'round the sun
Yeah you only
Only live once

So make lots of noise
Kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's what you're into
When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint I would
And follow your arrow
Wherever it points yeah
Follow your arrow
Wherever it points

There's a place I've been looking for
That took me in and out of buildings
Behind windows walls and doors
And I thought I found it
Couple times even settled down
And I'd hang around just long enough
To find my way back out
I know now the place that I was trying to
Reach
Was you right here in front of me


And I wouldn't change a thing
I'd walk right back through the rain
Back to every broken heart
On the day that it was breakin'
And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me here right here

It's amazing what I let my heart go through
To get me where it got me
In this moment here with you
And it passed me by
God knows how many times
I was so caught up in holding
What I never thought I'd find
I know now there's a million roads
I had to take
To get me in your arms that way



In a love I never thought I'd get to get to
-here
And if that's the road
God made me take to be with you



And I'd relive all the years
And be thankful for all the tears
I've cried with every stumbled step
That led to you and got me here right here
Oh baby-Ooo
Oh got me here

Thought you'd change the weather
Start a little storm
Make a little rain
But I'm gonna do one better hide the sun until you pray
I'm a tornado looking for a soul to take

You're gonna see me coming by the selfish things that you did
I'm gonna leave you guessin' how this funnel is gonna hit
I'm a tornado looking for a man to break

Yeah I'm gonna lift this house spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found

Thought you'd take a swing
Try another girl try another night
But it's the pain that brings my force of nature back to life
I'm a tornado more disturbed than an F5

Hey I'm gonna lift this house spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
I'm gonna lift this house spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found oh yeah

OOOOOOOOOOO
MMMMMMMMMM

I'm gonna lift this house spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
I'm gonna lift this house spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground
Make sure you're never found

The winds are getting stronger
And the sky is falling through
And you ain't got much longer
'Til the rage rips off the roof
I'm a tornado and I'm coming after you

Oooo
Hmm
Oooo

I'm gonna lift this house spin it all around
Toss it in the air and put it in the ground

One foot on the bus 'bout half past nine
I knew that you were leavin' this time
I thought about layin' down in it's path
Thinking that you might get off for that

I remember that night we laid in bed
Namin' all our kids that we hadn't had yet
One for your grandma and one for mine
Said we'd draw straws when it came time

I'll move on baby just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailin' ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart but I'll get through
Someday when I stop lovin' you

I bet all I had on a thing called love
I guess in the end it wasn't enough
And it's hard to watch you leave right now
I'm gonna have to learn to let you go somehow
Somehow

I'll move on baby just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailin' ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart but I'll get through
Someday when I stop lovin' you

Ooooooh
Oh someday
Yeah someday

I'll move on baby just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailin' ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart but I'll get through
Someday when I stop lovin' you

Someday when I stop lovin' you

Dancin' when the stars go blue
Dancin' when the evening fell
Dancin' in your wooden shoes
In a wedding gown

Dancin' out on 7th street
Dancin' through the underground
Dancin' with the marionette
Are you happy now

Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
stars go blue
stars go blue
stars go blue

Laughin' with your pretty mouth
Laughin' with your broken eyes
Laughin' with your lover's tongue
In a lullaby

Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
stars go blue
stars go blue
stars go blue

I got a girl crush hate to admit it but
I got a heart rush ain’t slowin’ down
I got it real bad want everything she has
That smile and the midnight laugh she’s givin’ you now

I wanna taste her lips yeah ‘cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair I want her magic touch
Yeah ‘cause maybe then you’d want me just as much
I got a girl crush I got a girl crush

I don’t get no sleep I don’t get no peace
Thinkin’ about her under your bed sheets
The way that she’s whisperin’ the way that she’s pullin’ you in
Lord knows I’ve tried I can’t get her off my mind

I wanna taste her lips yeah ‘cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair I want her magic touch
Yeah ‘cause maybe then you’d want me just as much
I got a girl crush

I got a girl crush hate to admit it but
I got a heart rush it ain’t slowin’ down

While I down Kentucky bourbon
I am waiting for a call
And the moon and stars tonight
Are playing shadows on the wall

With the moon the way it is dear
Would you answer out of spite
Or are you feeling lonely tonight

Cause I remember last time
We were out under the stars
Driving crooked down the highway
Drinking beer in roadside bars

And now and then I wonder
Why this painful memory
Can never find its way to you from me

And I can't dial the phone just now
Even though I know your number
Can't bring my broken heart to be untrue
Like you did today
You'll say goodbye the same old way
Ever since you hung up on me
I'm hung up on you

Well the house I'm ringing up from
Is a half a mile from you
But with the reception I'm getting
Might as well be Timbuktu

And behind the door of your home
Is a strange and foreign land
Where you speak a language I don't understand

And I can't dial the phone just now
Even though I know your number
Can't bring my broken heart to be untrue
Like you did today
You'll say goodbye the same old way
Ever since you hung up on me
I'm hung up on you

Now I'm going down to Jimmy's bar
Like a thousand other times
With an appetite for poison
And a suitcase full of dimes

And I'll wait there by the payphone
With one hundred other guys
With those sorry hung-up teardrops in our eyes

And I can't dial the phone just now
Even though I know your number
Can't bring my broken heart to be untrue
Like you did today
You'll say goodbye the same old way
Ever since you hung up on me
I'm hung up on you

That first cold September night
You were the blanket holding me tight
You were kissing me and the Earth stood still
You said we don't have to I said I will yeah
We ran in when the thunder came
You told me sugar melts in the rain
Don't want to watch our love go to waste
So we ran inside 'fore it was too late

Oh I Oh I I'm not even trying
Oh I Oh I but I can't stop smiling yeah


Do you think about me
Like I think about you
Do you think about me
Like I think about you yeah

I moved on to another town
Wrote you letters 'til the ink ran out
When the clouds rolled in I grabbed the keys
And played that song that we used to sing
I met a boy a lot like you
It's funny how he used to sing it too
But he was always just a little out of key
So much different than you and me

Oh I Oh I I'm not even trying
Oh I Oh I but I can't stop smiling yeah


Do you think about me
Like I think about you
Do you think about me
Like I think about you
Oh yeah


Sometimes I wonder if you wonder
What it could have been like
When you're sitting there drinking coffee
Are you thinking of me
When it's thundering and raining outside

Oh I oh I I'm not even trying
Oh I oh I but I can't stop smiling
Oh I oh I it's sending me flying
Oh I oh I but I can't stop smiling Yeah


Do you think about me
Like I think about you
Do you think about me
Like I think about you
Do you think about me
Like I think about you
Do you think about me

My heart's not ready for the rocking chair
I need somebody who really cares
So tired of livin' solitaire
Someday I'm gonna be
Safe in the arms of love

Strip your heart and it starts to snow
Love is a high-wire act I know
Someday I'll find a net below

Someday I'm gonna be
Safe in the arms of love
Safe in the arms of love

I want arms that know how to rock me
Safe in the arms of love
I wanna fall and know that love has caught me
Safe in the arms of love
Safe in the arms of love

I want a heart to be forever mine
Want eyes to see me satisfied
Gonna hang my heartaches out to dry
Some day I'm gonna be safe in the arms of love
Safe in the arms of love

I want arms that know how to rock me
Safe in the arms of love
I wanna fall and know that love has caught me
Safe in the arms of love
Safe in the arms of love
Safe in the arms of love

I heard you laughing in a crowd outside a restaurant we used to go to
I caught a glimpse that stopped me in my tracks
It took me back
You looked happy with that little girl up on your shoulders happy
I know where she got those crystal eyes of blue
Time’s been sweet to you


As bad as it was as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn’t get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you’re holding on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday you’ll see the reason why
Sometimes yeah sometimes there’s good in goodbye

I don’t regret it
The time we had together
I won’t forget it
But we both ended up where we belong
I guess goodbye made us strong
And yeah I’m happy
I found somebody too who makes me happy
And I knew one day I’ll see you on the street
And it’d be bittersweet


But as bad as it was as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn’t get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you’re holding on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday you’ll see the reason why
Yeah sometimes yeah sometimes there’s good in goodbye
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah


As bad as it was yeah as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn’t get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you’re holding on to someone that you got to let go
Someday you’ll see the reason why
Yeah someday you’ll see the reason why
There’s good in goodbye yeah
Yeah

There's good in goodbye mmm

The boy only wanting to give mother something
And all of her roses had bloomed

Looking at him as he came rushing in
knowing her roses were doomed

All she could see were some thorns buried deep
And tears that he cried as she tended his wounds

And she knew it was love it was what she could understand
He was showing his love and that's how he hurt his hands

He still remembers that night as a child on his mothers knee
She held him close and she opened her Bible and quietly started to read

Then seeing a picture of Jesus he cried out:
Mama he's got some scars just like me

And he knew it was love it was what he could understand
He was showing his love and that's how he hurt his hands



Now the boy is grown and moved out on his own
When Uncle Sam comes along
A foreign affair but our young men are there
And luck had his number drawn

It wasn't that long till our hero was gone he gave to a friend what he learned from the cross

But they knew it was love it one they could understand
He was showing his love and that's how he hurt his hands

It was one they could understand

He was showing his love and that's how he hurt his hands

Pop ahh
If it pops into my head 
it's comin' straight out my mouth
If you ain't treatin' me right 
It's somethin' you'll hear about
I can't be little Miss Sunshine all of the time
If you want a piece of my heart 
You'll get a piece of my mind

Oh If I got something to say
Oh If I ain't gettin' my way
Oh If it's important to me

I'll stand up n scream to get what I need
I got a big mouth 
I got a big mouth
Don't care what you think
I don't give a Beep
As long as you listen to me
When I turn it up n sing aloud
'Cuz I'm not afraidto give you a taste
Without the sugarcoat babe
What can I saythe words just come out
I got a big mouth

Some people go with the crowd 
They never say what they think
They don't wanna rock the boat
'Cuz they're afraid it'll sink
But I can't sit on my hands
when I know somethin' ain't right
'Cuz when ya bottle up it up baby
It'll eat you alive

Oh If I got something to say
Oh If I ain't gettin' my way
Oh If it's important to me

I'll stand up n scream to get what I need
I got a big mouth 
I got a big mouth
Don't care what you think
I don't give a Beep 
As long as you listen to me
When I turn it up n sing aloud
'Cuz I'm not afraidto give you a taste
Without the sugarcoat babe
What can I saythe words just come out
I got a big mouth


Haven't you ever wished you could go back in time 
and do somethin' different
Haven't you ever wished you could go back tonight
say what you really meantsay what you really meant

If it pops into my head
It's comin' straight out my mouth
If you ain't treatin' me right right right right
I'll stand up n scream to get what I want
I got a big mouth 
I got a big mouth
Don't care what you think
I don't give a Beep 
As long as you listen to me as long as you listen to me
When I turn it up n sing aloud
'Cuz I'm not afraid I'm not afraidto give you a taste
Without the sugarcoat babe
What can I say what can I saythe words just come out
I got a big mouth

It's not the right time that's what you say
But you're wrong
I'm impatient 'cuz I know what I want
I can't wait around 'til you're done
I know she's tall n blonde
But I know I'm the one

You're in love with me n you just don't know it yet
Everyone sees it but you won't admit
That you're already in too deep n there's no goin' back No oh
How much longer are you gonna hide
Make up your mind before you run out of time
I know that she's beautiful
But our love's inevitable

You said 'don't ask me about her' that's the rule
It drives me crazy just the thought of her under you
Why don't you tell her about me
Tell her the truth honey
It would make things a whole lot easier for you n me

You're in love with me n you just don't know it yet
Everyone sees it but you won't admit
That you're already in too deep n there's no goin' back No oh
How much longer are you gonna hide
Make up your mind before you run out of time
I know that she's beautiful
But our love's inevitable


And like the night sticks to day
And like the star breaks the rain 
Oh baby it's inevitable
It's just a matter of time until you n I will be together

'Cuz you're in love with me n just don't know it yet
Everyone sees it but you won't admit
That you're already in so deep n there's no goin' back

And you're in love with me n just don't know it yet
Everyone sees it  but you won't admit
That you're already in so deep there's no goin' back
How much longer are you gonna hide
Make up your mind before you run out of time
Hey I know she's beautiful
But our love's inevitable

Everywhere I go
They're starin' at her
Every man I know
He wants to have her
I guess I oughta be
A jealous man
I look the other way
They're hittin' on her
Every night and day
They telephone her
They try and get to her
But I know they can't

'Cause she never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talkin'
She starts walkin'
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart

She walks into the room
And everybody watches every move
Hopin' she don't love me
I know it by the way
They hang around
But they don't realize
There's more to her
Than what meets the eye
That's why I'm certain
No matter what they do
To reach her now

She never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talkin'
She starts walkin'
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart

When they start talkin'
She starts walkin'
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart
never lets it go to her heart

Once upon a time our world was on fire and I loved to watch it burn
Wild and reckless never any limits guess I had a lot to learn
Cause fire turns to embers embers to ashes that blow away too soon


Now everything after you is like having wine after whiskey
It went from do anything for you babe to you don’t even miss me
Once you’ve tasted a love that strong you can’t go back
And you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me It’s like having wine after whiskey

Looking back I guess it's really for the best still you’re something that I crave
Even though I know it was right to let you go You’re a habit hard to break
I got used to being high and nothing that I try seems good enough right now


It’s all so watered down like having wine after whiskey
It went from do anything for you babe to you don’t even miss me
Once you’ve tasted a love that strong
You can’t go back and you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me It’s like having wine after whiskey


Once you’ve tasted a love that strong you can’t go back
And you can’t settle on anything less
And that’s what gets me
It's like having wine
It’s like having wine after whiskey

Can't get enough of this everyday love
Can't get enough of this everyday love

Each morning the sun shines through my window
Lands on the face of a dream come true
I shuffle to the kitchen for my coffee
And catch up on the front page morning news
Then she walks up behind me and throws her arms around my neck
Just another normal thing I've come to expect


It's ordinary plain and simple
Typical this everyday love
Same ol' same ol' keeping it new
Same ol'/This everyday love
Emotional so familiar
Nothing about it too peculiar
Oh but I can't get enough
Of this everyday love

Every afternoon I make a phone call
Listen to the voice that warms my heart
I drag myself through a few more hours
Then head on home to try and beat the dark
Her smile will be right there when I step through that door
And it will be that way tomorrow just like everyday before



Wouldn't change one single thing about it
No it's run-of-the-mill still I can't live without it



Yeah of this everyday love
Can't get enough of this everyday love
Can't get enough of this everyday love
Can't get enough of this everyday love
Can't get enough

What I'm lookin' for
Is a love that's forever
Someone who can capture my soul in a heartbeat
And stay for all time
What I'm prayin' for
Is a match made in heaven
Someone who will worship my body
And still put his heart on the line
Commitment
Someone who'll go the distance
I need somebody with staying power
Who will make me go weak in the knees
Commitment
And everything that goes with it
I need honor and love in my life from somebody
Who's playin' for keeps
What I'm searching for
Is a man who'll stand by me
Who will walk through the fire
And be my flame in the night
I won't settle for
Less than what I deserve
A friend and a lover who'll love me
For the rest of my life
Commitment
Someone who'll go the distance
I need somebody with staying power
Who will make me go weak in the knees
Commitment
And everything that goes with it
I need honor and love in my life from somebody
Who's playin' for keeps
Yeah I've had promises broken
Three words left unspoken
They just left me achin' for more
But I've found temptation
I won't be impatient
There's one thing that's worth waitin' for
Commitment
And everything that goes with it
I need honor and love in my life from somebody
Who's playin' for keeps
Commitment
Someone who'll go the distance
I need somebody with staying power
Who will make me go weak in the knees
Commitment
And everything that goes with it
I need honor and love in my life from somebody
Who's playin' for keeps

Look's like everybody's here
Had to put some folding chairs in the vestibule
Yeah it's gettin' full
Even old Aunt Ruby came
Her first time on an airplane
It's her sister's girl
She wouldn't miss it for the world
And all them kids jumpin' in the pew
And Mr Charlie in his lime-green suit is a handsome man
Remarks widow Callahan
Uncle Joe and Uncle Jake
Haven't spoken since '98 just said Hello
It's a good day to let it go

So let the angels gather
Let the music play
Let the preacher get to preachin' all the do you takes
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air
Let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limousine
Love is a beautiful thing

Daddy's waiting with the bride
As she helps him with his tie she sees a tear
He says Man it's hot in here
He hugs his little girl and asks
How did you grow up so fast God I wish
Your momma could be here for this
And everybody stands and smiles
As she comes walkin down the aisle in her momma's gown
And daddy breaks on down
Gran and gramps in the second row
Stood right there 50 years ago
And said their vows
Yeah I guess that's working out

So let the angels gather
Let the music play
Let the preacher get to preachin' all the do you takes
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air
Let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limousine
Love is a beautiful thing

A little table full of gifts
Catering is cover dish and the wedding band
Well that's on her hand
Tommy's teasing Lorali
He pushed her down
He made her cry
And neither one knows the day will come

When the angels gather
And the music plays
And the preacher get to preachin' all the do you takes
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air
Let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limousine
Love two people in love is a beautiful thing

Funny how love can make you feel
Crush you like a ton of steel
Fake you out make you think it’s real
Funny how love can make you feel yeah


Ouh ouh yeah
I just can’t leave love alone
I just can’t leave love alone
I just can’t leave love alone
I just can’t leave love alone
Hey

Sweetest buzz and the highest high
When you can’t walk to the other side
Ain’t it funny how love can make you fly


Ouh I can’t stop it
Ouh gotta have it want it
I can’t help it
I just can’t leave love alone
I just can’t leave love alone
Can’t leave it alone

I just can’t leave love alone
I just can’t leave love alone
I just can’t leave love alone
I just can’t leave love alone
I can’t leave it alone
I can’t leave it

Gotten too far off the map
Not so sure I can get back
Was I the one who drifted off
Did I take advantage of good love
'Cause I swear I did everything I could've done
But what good is love without the trust
Does anybody wanna

Put me back put me back on the map
I'd be all about it
I'd do anything anything
That you asked
'Cause honestly I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

Something steady something good
Is probably closer than I thought it could be
All this off the grid is getting old
And my compass says I'm getting close
But I don't know it's hard to read
So I'll just keep moving
Hoping someone out there's gonna

Put me back put me back on the map
I'd be all about it
I'd do anything anything
That you asked
'Cause honestly I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

SOS it's out of hand
Just holding out for love again
I'm sending signals find me fast
I know I know
There's gotta be somebody who can

Put me back put me back on the map
Cause I'd be all about it
I'd do anything anything
That you asked
'Cause honestly I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

I been hangin' round this place I been lookin' through your space
I been waitin' for you I've been waitin' for you
All the places that you go all the people that you know
I've been lookin' for you I've been lookin' for you

And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got somethin' in their pockets all got somethin' on their face
They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard
Singin' hallelujah while they dance over the stars
They all say they're goin' far

Me I've been lookin' for you baby I've been lookin' for you baby
I've been lookin' for you baby I've been lookin' for you baby
All night long all night long all night long

Someone said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land
So I've been out here all night lookin' for your footprints in the sand
Did you hear the ocean singing baby did you sing along
While you danced out in the water to some ol' forgotten song
Were you even here at all

Me I've been lookin' for you baby I've been lookin' for you baby
I've been lookin' for you baby I've been lookin' for you baby
All night long all night long all night long

Somehow I wound up in the desert just after daylight
Where the Joshua Trees grow that little place you always liked
These pioneer town people ain't got too much to say
And if you ever were here baby they ain't givin' you away

Now it's been two days
I'm still lookin' for you baby I've been lookin' for you baby
I've been lookin' for you baby I've been lookin' for you baby
All night long all night long all night long

And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got somethin' in their pockets all got somethin' on their face

Someone said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land
So I've been out here all night lookin' for your footprints in the sand

Think I'll go back to the city back to El Cerrito Place
That's the last time that I saw that pretty smile upon your face
I've been lookin' for you baby

Would it bother you to know his hands have been all over me
And would it bother you to know I'll run to him next time you leave oh yeah eh
When you hit the road n disappear and leave me here
I'm not sure what you're doin' out there or who you're doin' it with
Oh you're probably at some sweet hotel with some groupie whore
But what the hell or maybe that's just somethin' I tell myself

When I run my nails down his back n he kisses me on my neck
He feels me but it kills me
Such a bittersweet passion pain I bite my lip not to scream your name 
Oh baby I feel everything but guilty

Would it bother you to know he drinks your Southern Comfort when you're gone oh yeah eh
And would it bother you to know he picks up your guitar n plays your songs oh yes he does
And I wear your band t-shirt to bed imagine that I'm with you instead but you're not here
No you're never here
Oh you're probably in the back of your bus satisfying your all night lust 
Oh baby that's just something I tell myself

When I run my nails down his back n he kisses me on my neck
He feels me but it kills me
It's a bittersweet passionate pain I bite my lip not to scream your name 
Oh baby I feel everything but guilty

Would it bother you to know he says he's in love with me

When I run my nails down his back n he kisses me on my neck
He feels me but it kills me
It's a bittersweet passion pain I bite my lip not to scream your name 
Oh baby I feel everything but guilty  oh oh

Would it bother you baby

Everybody down in Houston calls him Texas
Everybody way up North calls him Cornbread
You shoulda heard the way that his momma called him baby
Daddy called him boy his friends call him crazy

Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting and the high and the heat and the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me
I shoulda just called him Whiskey

Warm my body to the core just like a blanket
His face was so sweet then he took my breath away
Hit me so hard like a rock through a window
I knew I was in trouble from the moment I met you boy

Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting and the high and the heat and the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me
I shoulda just called him Whiskey

Now the numb has set in
He's gone like the wind
And I can barely feel the pain

Shoulda just called it like I saw it
I shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting and the high and the heat and the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me
The burn and the sting and the high and the heat and the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me
I shoulda just called him Whiskey
Shoulda just called him Whiskey
I shoulda just called him Whiskey

Flip flops and bottle tops strown across this hotel room
What a night what a party
What a place Cancun
Got your pretty little head on my sunburnt chest
Girl we're wasting the day away
And it sure feels right with you right by my side
And I barely even know your name

Baby your deep blue eyes
And your golden tropicana tan
And the taste of wine on your sweet lips sure did me in
Never felt like this from just one kiss
Never been in such a big old mess
Til I saw you in the moonlight dancing in that little sundress

The band was groovin'
Had everybody moving to the rhythm of a reggae tune
All the people all the faces
All I saw was you
Now I'm wrapped in your arms
And I never wanna leave this below the border love affair
There's a plane taking off with an empty seat
And I don't even care

Baby your deep blue eyes
And your golden tropicana tan
And the taste of wine on your sweet lips sure did me in
Never felt like this from just one kiss
Never been in such a big old mess
Til I saw you in the moonlight dancing in that little sundress

Ain't it crazy how I found you 
In a world full of girls
Girl what did you do

Baby your deep blue eyes
And your golden tropicana tan
And the taste of wine on your sweet lips sure did me in
Never felt like this from just one kiss
Never been in such a big old mess
Til I saw you in the moonlight dancing in that little sundress

Yeah
Won’t do no good if you run from me
There ain’t no cheatin’ schemin’ my heart don’t see
You left your troubles in my head in my head
You left your secrets in my bed in my bed
You’re like the cover of a book that’s been read baby
I know what line is coming next coming next

You can’t hide from me
There ain’t no tricks that you can try on me
I know your every move before you even breathe baby
Thinking you know something I don’t know
But my eyes my eyes my eyes are like a telescope

You’re kissing her when my head is turned
You must be crazy baby haven’t you learned
You can’t deceive me silly child silly child
I don’t believe that greedy smile greedy smile
My intuition can see for miles and miles baby
Every little sin and everywhere you’ve been

You can’t hide from me
There ain’t no tricks that you can try on me
I know your every move before you even breathe baby
Thinking you know something I don’t know
But my eyes my eyes my eyes are like a telescope
Yeah yeah

You left your troubles in my head in my head
You left your secrets in my bed

You can’t hide from me
There ain’t no tricks that you can try on me
I know your every move before you even breathe baby
Thinking you know something I don’t know
But my eyes my eyes my eyes are like a telescope

You can’t hide from me
There ain’t no tricks that you can try on me
I know your every move before you even breathe baby
Thinking you know something I don’t know
But my eyes my eyes my eyes are like a telescope

She left that loser in a dust cloud
Heart in his hand chin on the ground
Cried her last tear for that clown
She can see a little clearer now
She said Oh oh I gotta go and find me
Oh oh she found the strength to break free


Like a painted wild mustang
Flyin' out across the open range
Finally gets to live her life that way
No fear no fences nobody-no reins

No reins

All she's ever felt is held back
She says It's kinda nice to hear myself laugh
She's gonna do a lot more of that
She's makin' plans and makin' tracks
She said Oh oh I gotta go and find me
Oh oh she found the strength to break free



Oh oh she's learnin' how to let go
Oh oh whichever way the wind blows
Oh oh she's learnin' how to let go



No reins

The sun kisses the windowsill 
And I am still on my second cup of pity me
Yeah it's been a long night chasing ghosts 
But at the most it's been a rude awakening
That all too late I finally see
That it's - 


My loss my lonely
My mistake mine only
Mine all mine all mine
And it's my bad my broken
All my should haves left unspoken
Mine all mine all mine - yeah

I drove you to the edge of the map 
And after that I pushed you off just 
to watch you fall
You never were the bounce back kind
But boy this time you've proven me wrong 
after all
Now I'm the one who's gonna crawl
'Cause it's - 




Always thought I'd get to sorry
But the chance has come and gone
So if it finds it's way back in
I'll hold on hold on hold on

My loss my lonely
My mistake mine only
Mine all mine all 
Mine all mine all
Mine all mine
It's mine all mine
It's mine all mine
Yeah it's mine all mine
All mine all mine
All mine all mine



On the edge lookin over
All I see is a four leaf clover
Maybe a sign of things to come                         
Should I jump or should I run                          

After I fall where do I stand                          
After my heart is in your hands                           
And you've got it all                         
After I fall where do I stand                          
After I've loved you all I can                         
Will I still stand tall  
After I fall                                                   

It's as clear as the blue sky
I don't fear you tellin me a lie
So I'll become your only dancer
And let the sunrise bring me answer

After I fall where do I stand
After my heart is in your hands 
And you've got it all
After I fall where do I stand
After I've loved you all I can
Will I still stand tall
After I fall

You're a move I wanna make
You're a chance I'm gonna take
You're every dream oh

After I fall where do I stand
After my heart is in your hands 
And you've got it all
After I fall where do I stand
After I've loved you all I can
Will I still stand tall
After I fall

Time stands still for no one
I know this is true
I've been stuck here waiting
Then along came you
And you gave me back
The love I had
The faith I'd lost
The life I knew


I wanna thank you for the love that you give me
And the sun that you put in my sky
You don't know how much you've lifted me up
But I feel so alive
That I could fly
I could fly oh

There's no way I could've made it this far
Without you
You came to me just when I needed someone to believe
That I could make it through
And you gave me back
The love I had
The faith I'd lost
The life I knew



Above the clouds
Fly so high never come down
Just you and I I'm so in love
With you with you
And you gave me back
The love I had
The faith I'd lost
The life I knew

I wanna thank you for the love that you give me
And the sun that you put in my sky
You don't know how much you've lifted me up
But I feel so alive



And I could fly I could fly oh
I wanna spread my wings
Let me tell you
Said I need your love I need your love
Stay with me baby
Oh I need your love and I need your love
Stay with me baby
Oh I need your love I need your love
Stay with me baby
Yeah I need your love and I need your love
Stay with me honey baby c'mon now stay
C'mon now yeah

You and me side by side walkin' through the woods in the pale moonlight
Oh yeah now and it feels so good

The road I have traveled on
Is paved with good intentions
It's littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true

When all of my hopes were dying
Her love kept me trying
She does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through

When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fear she feels inside

So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cos I die a little each time
When she cries

She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side

I don't know how she takes it
Just once I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her lovin' eyes

When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fear she feels inside

So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cos I die a little each time
When she cries

So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cos I die a little each time
When she cries

I was standing
At the end of my rainbow
Nowhere to go
And no pot of gold in sight

All my wishes
Were just way too much to hope for
But when I saw you
I knew I'd seen the light

And not a moment too soon
Without a minute to spare
You touched my heart

Ooooo don't you think it's a pretty good plan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
take me to the Islands put my feet in the sand
rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean 
singin Silent Night with the palm trees ablowin'

Ooooo don't you think it's a pretty good plan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

Well if you're thinkin' bout getting me a present this year
let me put a bug in your cute little ear
How bout two tickets to a tropical shore 
where we don't have to wear these winter clothes anymore
instead of turkey we'll have mahi-mahi grill
and Pina Coladas in the blender chillin'

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
take me to the Islands put my feet in the sand
rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean 
singin Silent Night with the palm trees ablowin'

Ooooo don't you think it's a pretty good planits a real good plan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

Well everybody's praying for a Christmas so white
come to think about it that'd be alright
as long as it's sand and not snow on the ground
and everyday our skin gets a little more brown
We'll string some lights in a coconut tree
I'll rub some oil on you and you can rub some on me

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
I can see us baby on the beach hand in hand
rockin' to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean
Baby won't you say you and me we'll be going
Ooooo I can almost feel my toes in the sandmy toes in the sand
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

Don't worry baby we'll celebrate plenty
I'll buy you some shades and a brand new bikini
We won't have to worry about the holiday rush
it'll be you and me fallin' deeper in love

Ooooo don't you think it's a pretty good planits a real good plan
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
a real good tan

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

Blowing out the candles on another birthday cake
Old enough to look back and laugh at my mistakes
Young enough to look at the future and like what I see
My best days are ahead of me

Life hasn't always been a party
But mostly it's been good
There's only one or two things
That I'd change if I could
I don't get lost in the past
Or get stuck in some sad memory yeah
My best days are ahead of me

Age ain't nothing but a number
Sometimes I have to wonder what does it really mean
Hey I'm still putting it together
I keep getting better if I keep getting better
I can be whatever I wanna be
My best days are ahead of me

I've got sunsets to witness
Dreams to dance with
Beaches to walk on
And lovers to kiss
There's a whole lot of world out there
That I can't wait to see
My best days are ahead of me

My best days are ahead of me

Lipstick pretty face and maybe you'll notice something
Different bout me different bout me
Yeah you talk talk all you want
You pour your heart out
But you never do see you never do see me
I cant wait around forever for you

Sooner or later
You're gonna come around and you'll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always everything that you needed
Sooner or later you're gonna wish you had me
Yeah you're gonna wish you had me

Well she don't do nothing for you
But mess you up
Yeah she messes you up
I'm your shoulder I'm the quick drive over
Tryin' to fix your stuff well I give up
Oo you'll never see me standin' right in front of you

Sooner or later
You're gonna come around and you'll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always everything that you needed
Sooner or later you're gonna wish you had me
Oo oo

Oh but its a little too late for that

Lipstick pretty face and maybe you'll notice something
Different bout me different bout me

You're gonna come around and you'll be sorry
When you figure out
That I was always everything that you needed
Sooner or later oh

You're gonna wish you had me oh
You're gonna wish you had me oh
You're gonna wish you had me

I was standin' with my friend when I saw you walkin' in
And my heart started skippin' a beat
I was tryin' to play it cool but I knew it was true
That nobody would ever compete

Well first comes love and then comes
First date first kiss we were checkin' off the list
Then you were gettin' down on your knee
And you didn't have to guess it was always a yes
Now there's two less fish in the sea

Let's set the date
Let's hire the band
Let's cut the cake
Tie up the cans

I love the ring of your name
You're the ying to my yang
Oh baby let's give it a shot
Every wall needs a frame
Every ball needs a chain
I'm talkin' about tying the knot
Tie it up

Something old something new
Something borrowed something blue
And the chairs lined up in the yard
The I do's and the kisses
From a miss to a misses
Can't wait for forever to start

Let's set the date
Let's hire the band
Let's cut the cake
Tie up the cans

I love the ring of your name
You're the ying to my yang
So baby let's give it a shot
Every wall needs a frame
Every ball needs a chain
I'm talkin' about tying the knot
Tie it up

Tie it up
Invite the town
Let's raise a glass and lock it down
Tie it up
Forever bound
Cause I'm fit to be tied down

When mama's kickin' off her shoes
And daddy's spinnin' from the booze
And the last song is finally sung
We can run to the room
Kickstart the honeymoon
Don't it sound like a whole lotta fun

Let's set the date
Let's hire the band
Let's cut the cake
Tie up the cans

I love the ring of your name
You're the ying to my yang
So baby let's give it a shot
Every wall needs a frame
Every ball needs a chain
I'm talkin' about tying the knot
Tie it up
Tie it up
Tie it up

I thought I was doing all right being alone 
I swore I'd never let somebody get close again 
I was never gonna let my guard down Not for anyone 
But there's a light in your eyes and it's got me moving' in 
And tonight these walls are all coming down 

And my heart is open 
I'm letting you in 
Cause you give me a reason and the faith I've been needing to start again 
And your love is healing 
I'm finally breathing 
I've been waiting so long hoping for this moment 
My heart is open 

These days it seems like everybody's just walking away 
Like there's no forever and love is just a game 
But don't you know you can believe me when I say that I'm your man 

My heart is open 
I'm letting you in baby 
Cause you give me a reason and the faith I've been needing to start again 
And your love is healing 
I'm finally breathing 
I've been waiting so long hoping for this moment 
My heart is open 

I can't wait anymore no no 
Because I've got nothing left to prove 
And I've got so much left to use 
That's why I'm tearing out the walls and baby I'm kicking down the doors 

And your love is healing 
Baby I'm finally breathing 
I can hear you calling I'm ready to fall in love again 
My heart is open 

My heart is open 

My heart is open

Don't don't you wish we tried
Do you feel what I feel inside
You know love is stronger than pride
Don't no don't
Let your anger grow
Just tell me what you need me to know
Please talk to me don't close the door
Cause I wanna hear you wanna be near you

Don't fight don't argue
Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away don't tell me to go

Don't don't give up on trust
Don't give up on me on us
We could just hold on long enough
We can do it we'll get through it

Don't fight don't argue
Just give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away don't tell me to go

Don't pretend that it's ok

And don't do something you might regret someday

Don't fight don't argue
Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you don't give up on me
Don't turn me away don't tell me to go

Well let's begin with the day I met her
How fast this good old boy's world got better
Sky got bluer the grass got greener
Just the first few seconds after I first seen her

Like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
My best old jeans and my broke in sneakers
A home run pitch floating right down the middle
The sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle

She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to loving me
She's everything I mean bulls eye perfect
She's right on the money

She's no red lights when I've overslept
She's a three point jump shot that's nothing but net
A hand full of aces the dealer's done dealing
I'm forever on a roll that's how she's got me feeling

She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to loving me
She's everything I mean bulls eye perfect
She's right on the money

She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt her
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her

She's right on the money
She goes directly to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I mean bulls eye perfect

She's right on the money
She goes directly to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I mean bulls eye perfect
She's right on the money

If I ever write the story of my life
Don't be surprised if you're where it begins
Girl I'd have to dedicate every line on every page
To the memories we made while you loved me


I was born the day you kissed me
And I died inside the night you left me
But I lived oh how I lived
I livedWhile you loved me

I'd start with chapter one love innocent and young
As a morning sun on a new day
Even though I know the end Well I'd do it all again
'Cause I got a lifetime in while you loved me







I thought it was over baby
We said our goodbyes
But I can't go a day without your face
Goin' through my mind

In fact not a single minute
Passes without you in it
Your voice your touch memories of your love
Are with me all of the time

Let me let go baby
Let me let go
If this is for the best
Why are you still in my heart
Are you still in my soul
Let me let go

I talked to you the other day
Looks like you make your escape
You put us behind no matter how I try
I can't do the same

Let me let go baby
Let me let go
It just isn't right
I've been two thousand miles
Down a dead-end road

Let me let go darlin' won't you
I just gotta know yeah
If this is for the best
Why are you still in my heart
Are you still in my soul
Let me let go

The lights of this strange city are shinin'
But they don't hold no fascination for me
I try to find the bright side baby
But everywhere I look
Everywhere I turn
You're all I see

Let me let me let go baby won't you
Let me let go
It just isn't right
I've been two thousand miles
Down a dead-end road

Oh let me let go darlin' won't you
I just gotta know
If this is for the best
Why are you still in my heart
Yeah you're still in my soul let me let go
Let me let go let me let go

They used to call me lightning
I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own
In the saddles on my bike
I had a reputation
For never staying very long
Just like a wild and restless drifter
Like a cowboy in a song

I met a darkhaired beauty
Where they lay the whiskey down
In southern Arizona
In a little border town
She had to dance for money
In that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
Played that girl a tune yeah

Never see it comin'
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
And the fire in her eyes
That makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun

She was sittin' on my lap
We still had shots to kill
When a man pulled up
Who owned the bar
In a Cadillac Deville
Grabbed her by her raven hair
And threw her on the floor
Said No free rides for the cowboys
That ain't what I pay you for no

She jumped up and grabbed my pistol
Stuck it in the fat man's back
Said Open up the safe
And put your money in the sack
Then tied his hands behind him
And put a blindfold on his eyes
Said If you're dumb enough to chase us man
You're dumb enough to die

Never see it comin'
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
And the fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table
And the bullets in the gun

We rode across the border
Down into Mexico
When you're runnin' from the law
Ain't that where everybody goes
We came upon a town
With a name I couldn't spell
She gave me what I came for
In that Mexican motel

I woke up to sirens
And the sound of running feet
Near 50 Federals locked and loaded in the street
She grabbed my 44
I grabbed the money in the sack
I kissed her for the last time
And we headed out the back

Every gun was on us
And every heartbeat pounded
The only thing that's left to do
When they got you all surrounded
She fired that old pistol
But we didn't stand a prayer
Money hit the gravel
Bullets filled the air

Never see it comin'
Just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
And the fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun

Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun

I like the feel of your name on my lips
and I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
The way that your fingers run through my hair
and how your scent lingers even when you're not there

And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
and how you enjoy your two hour bath
And how you convinced me to dance in the rain
with everyone watching like we were insane


But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild slow and easy
Heart and soul so completely
I love the way you love me

I like to imitate ol' Jerry Lee
an' watch you roll your eyes when I'm slightly off-key
And I like the innocent way that you cry
at sappy old movies you've seen hundreds of times



And I could list a million things I love to like about you
but they all come down to one reason I could never live without you



If there were no words
No way to speak
I would still hear you
If there were no tears
No way to feel inside
I'd still feel for you

And even if the sun refused to shine
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
You would still have my heart until the end of time
You're all I need my love my Valentine

All of my life
I have been waiting for
All you give to me
You've opened my eyes
And shown me how to love unselfishly

I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
In my dreams I couldn't love you more
I will give you my heart
Until the end of time
You're all I need my love my Valentine

And even if the sun refused to shine
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
You would still have my heart until the end of time
'Cause all I need is you my Valentine
You're all I need my love my Valentine

Everybody needs it
Everybody wants it
Everybody's searching for someone
Been down a thousand highways
I never thought would end
Baby I've been


Waiting all my life to find you
Always been one step behind you
Your love babe
I've been waiting all my life

I was tired of waiting
Every night was praying
Everyday would be the day I'd find you
I grew so impatient how long would it take
To know you were out there somewhere 
Somewhere waiting wondering just like me


I've been waiting all my life to love you
All that time I was dreaming of you
Your love babe
I've been waiting all my life

And did I lose faith did I lose heart
Maybe I did but I never lost my way
To where you are-I've been





Your love I've been waiting
Your love I've been waiting all my life
All my life all my life

Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
As the village children fight each other for their share
And the six-o-nine goes roaring past the creek
As Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week

I saw Grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really doing fine for eighty-four
And she asked me if sometime I could fix her barn
The poor old girl she needs a hand to run that farm


And it's good old country comfort in my bones
It's the sweetest sound these ears have ever known
It's just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort and a truck that's goin' back home
Oh it's goin' back home

Down at the well they've got a new machine
The foreman says it'll cut manpower by fifteen
Hey but that ain't natural old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day



Country comfort and a truck that's goin' back home
Whoa it's goin' back home
Hey take me back home
And a truck and a truck that's goin' back home
Any truck

Out of nowhere you just wanna be free
Cut me loose forget all about me
Baby tell me have you ever heard
About this little five letter word

What comes around goes around
I'm telling you baby it's called karma
What goes up comes down
Hits the ground
You're gonna find out
All about all about
Kkkkkkarma

So go on go on go have your day in the sun
Have a blast honey
Have you some fun
But don't forget about that golden rule
What you do to others is gonna get done to you

What comes around goes around
I'm telling you baby it's called karma
What goes up comes down
Hits the ground
You're gonna find out
All about all about
kkkkkkarma

Life is like a kaleidoscope
Changing colors every day
But there is one thing that I know
You can't mess around with your fate
Go on go on go on

What comes around goes around
I'm telling you baby it's called karma
What goes up comes down
Hits the ground
You're gonna find out
All about all about
Kkkkkkarma
I'm telling you baby it's called karma
What goes up comes down
Hits the ground
You're gonna find out 
All about all about
Kkkkkkarma
Yeah it's called karma
Kkkkkkarma

Hot sun dancin' on the river
We're sittin on the bank and watch the world go by
Our feet in the water she pressed her lips to mine
We were so long on love but short on time
She could be a honeymoon sweet and a little wild
But she was mine oh for a little while

And I laugh everytime I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in style
And she's gone but she let me with a smile
'Cause she was mine for a little while

We'd take a ride and head on down to airport road
Put the seats back watch the planes leave town
She always said nobody's strong enough to tie her down
Oh but I wasn't lookin' for that anyhow
I knew she'd leave but I didn't know when
It matters to me now oh but it didn't back then

And I laugh everytime I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in style
And she's gone but she let me with a smile
'Cause she was mine for a little while

I keep seein' pictures now of me and her and those summer nights
My mind fills with her
Oh but it's alright
'Cause I laugh everytime I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in style
And she's gone but she let me with a smile
'Cause she was mine for a little while
Yeah she was mine for a little while

No Good Two Timin' Lies comin' outta your mouth 
Cheatin' mistreatin' games that you play brought you down

I've been missing all the vital signs
That I needed for love to work
Engine of a heart that would not start
had to jump it so much it hurt
Everytime I looked under the hood 
It was always a mystery
You pulled up in a rescue truck and
Showed up with a master key
And revved it up for me


My Pulse was nearly gone 
I was almost in need of a defibrilator
I didn't know what went wrong
I had to shake it off but i got stuck
Oh my God you turned all my loose strings
You're the love innovator that brings 
All the right tools you know what to do
Fine tune
Fine tune

You started tweaking on a little knob
That I didn't even know was there
Kissing on my wrist all the way to my neck
Running your fingers through my hair
I felt like I was dizzy and I didn't think I could drive
You flipped a switch hotwired my gears
Yeah you put me in line
And now I'm running right


My Pulse was nearly gone 
I was almost in need of a defibrilator
I didn't know what went wrong
I had to shake it off but i got stuck
Oh my God you turned all my loose strings
You're the love innovator that brings 
All the right tools you know what to do
Fine tune
Fine tune


My Pulse was nearly gone 
I was almost in need of a defibrilator
I didn't know what went wrong
I had to shake it off but i got stuck
Oh my God you turned all my loose strings
You're the love innovator that brings 
All the right tools you know what to do
Fine tune
Fine tune


Cheap red wine straight out of a coffee cup
One more down to drink you off my mind
Lord knows I’ve tried a thousand times to give you up
But its closing time and we both know why


I’m just too selfish I guess
I know you’re tired and restless
It’s no surprise we’ve come undone
But I can’t unlove you just because
You say it’s better in the long run


We’ve been driving down this highway
Now we’re out of gas too far outta town
Oh here we are all tangled up and sideways
You’re all broken down yeah I’m breaking down

I’m just too selfish I guess
I know you’re tired and restless
It’s no surprise we’ve come undone
But I can’t unlove you just because
You say it’s better in the long run


Oh maybe somewhere a little down the line
I’ll get a little better leaving us behind
Maybe someday Oh I’ll be fine


Oh and you’ll move on and I will too
But still I don’t see gettin over you
Oh no no no

I’m just too selfish I guess
I know you’re tired and restless
It’s no surprise we’ve come undone ohh no
But I can’t unlove you just because
You say it’s better in the long run

In the long run
Oh in the long run
In the long run
In the long run

If you were the ocean and I was the sun
If the day made me heavy and gravity won
If I was the red and you were the blue
I could just fade into you

If you were a window and I was the rain
I’d pour myself out and wash off the pain
I’d fall like a tear so your light could shine through
Then I’d just fade into you

In your heart in your head
in your arms in your bed
under your skin
Til there’s no way to know
where you end and where I begin

If I was a shadow and you were a street
The cobblestone midnight is where
we first meet

Til the lights flickered out
we dance with the moon
Then I’d just fade into you

In your heart in your head
in your arms in your bed
under your skin
Til there’s no way to know
where you end and where I begin

I wanna melt in
I wanna soak through
I only wanna move when you move
I wanna breathe out
when you breathe in then
I wanna fade into you

If I was just ashes
and you were the ground
And under your willow
they laid me down

There’ll be no trace
that one was once two
After I fade into you

And I just fade into you

And I just fade into you

And I just fade into you

And I just fade into you

I wanna walk that line a little crooked
And live my life a little on the rocks
Laugh at every time my fell
Not afraid to make a fool of myself
And keep on dancing when the music stops

'Cause I love being in love
It's the best kind of drug
Drunk on the high leanin' on your shoulder
Sweeter like a wine as it gets older
When I die I don't wanna go sober
Oh when I die I don't wanna go sober

You're like drinking from a never-ending bottle
When I think it's gone there's always a little more left
Lay back with you and close my eyes
Let the big ol' world just spin on by
And sayin' your name with my last breath

'Cause I love being in love
It's the best kind of drug
Drunk on the high leanin' on your shoulder
Sweet like a wine as it gets older
When I die I don't wanna go sober
Oh when I die I don't wanna go sober

I love being in love
It's the best kind of drug
Drunk on the high leanin' on your shoulder
Sweet like a wine as it gets older
When I die I don't wanna go sober

Oh I love being in love
It's the best kind of drug
Drunk on the high leanin' on your shoulder
Sweet like a wine as it gets older
When I die I don't wanna go sober

Oh when I die I don't wanna go sober
Oh when I die I don't wanna go sober

I remember the windows rolled down and the wind in my hair
Driving 'round in your Daddy's old Chevy
Like we were going somewhere

We thought that summer would last us forever
Going steady was just something you do
I didn't know much about love
I learned that from you

Now those were some good times
Lately they don't seem to last
I guess I'm not nearly as strong as a drink in your glass
And the nights just get later
I can stay up and wait or just go on to bed like I do
I never knew nothing about lonely
I learned from that you

And I learned how to kiss on a ferris wheel
And I made wishes at wishing wells
And I fell into that fairytale too
And I know that love ain't so easy
But we tried didn't we baby
It's alright
Some dreams weren't meant to come true
I learned that from you

One night while the whole world was turning
I left you a note
And I told you that I'd always miss you
Then I let you go
I'm living outside of some town I ain't heard of
And I think about the boy I knew
I didn' t know you could fall out of love
I learned that from you

And I learned how to kiss on a ferris wheel
And I made wishes at wishing wells
And I fell into that fairytale too
And I know that love ain't so easy
But we tried didn't we baby
It's alright
Some dreams weren't meant to come true
I learned that from you

I remember the windows rolled down
And the wind

She got the long blonde hair
Got the red sports car
And you know she's got the
Top laid back
She got the movie star smile
Got the sun kissed tan
Santa Barbara in summer
Yeah she feels like that

Hey she's like a canyon drive
In a midnight sky
Those eyes are deep enough
To get lost
Her legs are palm tree tall
The way she walks
Like the heat on a runway
When the cameras go off

She's small town from the country
She ain't big time but she could be


Hey Hollywood never looked this
Good
Bright as the big screen burns
Hey I bet drivin' down Sunset
They're lookin' for a face like hers
Yeah I've been all around
This world
And she'd be California
If California was a girl

She's like a red red wine
Like a righteous wave
She's a day at the beach in Corona
Del Mar
She's never been out there
Felt the bright spot light
But she could have her own star
On that dreamer's boulevard

I've driven down that coastline
And I've stood there under that
Big sign


Hey Hollywood never looked this
Good
Bright as the big screen burns
Hey I bet drivin' down Sunset
They're lookin' for a face like hers
Yeah I've been all around
This world
And she'd be California
If California was a girl

I'd chase that wild sunset
I'd be gone on my way
Way out west
Yeah I've been all around
This town

Hey Hollywood never looked this good
Bright as the big screen
Hey I bet drivin' down Sunset
Lookin' for a face like hers
Yeah she'd be California
If California was a girl
Now she'd be California
If California was a girl
Hey California

She got the long blonde hair
Got the red sports car
And you know she's got the
Top laid back
She got the movie star smile
Got the sun kissed tan
Santa Barbara in summer
Yeah she feels like that

Yeah she'd be California
Hey Hollywood

Wasn't I good to you
Didn't I show it
And if I ever hurt you
I didn't know it

If you think I don't care
Then you're mistaken
My love was always there
But now my heart's breakin'


Oh baby oh what a crying shame
To let it all slip away
And call it yesterday
Oh baby my life would be so blue
My heart would break in two
Oh what a crying shame

'Cause I believed in you
From the beginning
I thought our love was true
But now it's all ending



Oh what a crying shame
Oh what a crying shame
Oh what a crying shame
Oh what a crying shame

If I didn't know better I'd hang my hat right there
If I didn't know better I'd follow you up the stairs

Stop saying those sweet things you know I like to hear
The horns are blowing louder and they're destroying me

Why do I keep drinking
Wasting my time on you
If I didn't know better
Well damnit
I do

There's a hole in what you're saying
I can plainly see
You have a lover that's waiting but baby you're right

Here with me
Ooh you might as well be the devil
Oh keeping me out past three
Oh you're the one with that apple so baby you can't
Blame me

Why don't you keep drinking
Get me one night with you
If I didn't know better
Well damnit
I do
You know that I do

Oh baby you're right here with me
Oh baby you know

I thought that this was supposed to feel good
And if you were really mine
I guess it would
I didn't fall in love
'Cause it was the right thing to do
I just went ahead and fell for you


Oh somewhere down along the line
I guess that love became a crime
This contradiction makes no sense
This is punishment
I feel like this is judgement day
I'll raise my hand stand up and say
I don't believe I'm innocent
This is punishment

Truth is your heart was never mine to take
Now I'm stuck in a feeling
That I'll never shake
I prayed for it to go
God knows I want it to stay
But here I am loving you either way




You'll never feel all the things I can't say
And I'll never know if it's better this way



Oh somewhere down along the line
I guess that love became a crime 
This is punishment
I feel like this is judgement day
I'll raise my hand stand up and say
This is punishment
This is punishment
This is punishment
This is this is this is punishment



When I wake up in the mornin' light
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right
I pull my blue jeans on I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on I pull my old blue jeans on

It's the weekend and I know that you're free
So pull on your jeans and come on out with me
Oh 'cause I need to have you near me
I need to feel you close to me
I need to have you near me I need to feel you close to me

You and me we'll go motorbike ridin' in the sun 
And the wind and the rain
I got money in my pocket I got a tiger in my tank
And I'm king of the road again

I'll meet ya in the usual place
You don't need a thing except your pretty face alright
I pull my blue jeans on I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on I pull my old blue jeans on
Aw here we go mama

You and me we'll go motorbike ridin' in the sun 
And the wind and the rain
I got money in my pocket I got a tiger in my tank
And I'm king of the road again

When I wake up in the mornin' light
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right
Hey I pull my blue jeans on I pull my old blue jeans on

I pull my blue jeans on I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on I pull my old blue jeans on

He was the kind of guy who loved so unselfishly
And everyone could see what a prize he was
Everyone but me
I must be blind
I must be the kind who don't know what they have
Till they're all alone and sad

There goes my baby
Like the sun fallin' out of the clear blue sky
There goes my baby
And it's gonna be a cold hard night
Now that I finally see
How I need him to be
Right here by my side
There goes my baby
Bye bye baby goodbye

How could I have a love so fine
And not know what it's worth
Maybe this empty heart he left behind
Is all that I deserve
What kind of fool
Finds a perfect jewel and can't see how it shines
Till she's all alone and cryin'

There goes my baby
Like the sun fallin' out of the clear blue sky
There goes my baby
And it's gonna be a cold hard night
Now that I finally see
How I need him to be
Right here by my side
There goes my baby
Bye bye baby goodbye

How I wish I could hold him in my arms and say
This time I'm gonna treat him right
But it's too late

There goes my baby
Like the sun fallin' out of the clear blue sky
There goes my baby
And it's gonna be a cold hard night
Now that I finally see
How I need him to be
Right here by my side
There goes my baby
Bye bye baby goodbye
Bye bye baby goodbye
Bye bye baby goodbye

I like I like I like I like I like I like I like I like I like

Up in the mornin I'll be your coffee cup
If you drink me down I will fill you up again
And if you don't think that's enough
I'll be the prize on the back of the cereal box
and the key that you found that you thought that you lost and
I'll be the why to your because

Because I I I am not perfect
But I I I I know I'm worth it
And I I I gotta believe there has to be a you
For every girl like me

I'll be the candy that feels like a firecracker pop
And the toy on the cake with the chocolate top and
and if you look a little closer
I'll be the steam on the grate as it floats in the air
Or the whisper you made from a secret you shared and
Your favorite song that's never over

Because I I I am not perfect
But I I I I know I'm worth it
And I I I gotta believe there has to be a you
For every girl like me

I like I like I like I like I like I like
Hot french fries and red balloon ties too
Your hoodie hangin down the street lamp on the corner of a
One way one way or another gonna get you too
Two times I take another look at the hat in the seat
And the wrapper you found and the flavor beneath of the tootsie pop drop don't stop cause I'll be your favorite
Are you free tonight stop by if you like if you might want to
I don't mind I don't mind
You will see it's me I believe you could be be the right one you
For every girl like me
Lalalalalala Like meeeeeeeee
And I I I
Lalalalalalalalala Like meeeeee
I I I
I like I like I like I like I like I like I I I

Now and then I confess you cross my mind
Now and then I guess I have a little too much time
I've changed my way of thinking
I've tried hard to separate what came too soon
From what came too late

I don't think about me in terms of you
I don't think about you in terms of us
I don't think about us in terms of love
I don't think about then in terms of now
I found a way to start again somehow
I don't think about what we thought it was
Oh in terms of love
Oh in terms of love

I'm countin' on heaven to understand
I didn't mean to go and mess up all the plans
Sometimes you know where you should go
Before you know the way
I'll bother with tomorrow
Once I made it through today

I don't think about me in terms of you
I don't think about you in terms of us
I don't think about us in terms of love
I don't think about then in terms of now
I found a way to start again somehow
I don't think about what we thought it was
Oh in terms of love
Mmmm hummm yeah

I don't think about black in terms of grey
Or revelations in the light of day
I don't think about cold in terms of ice
Or second chances happenin' twice

I don't think about me in terms of you
I don't think about you in terms of us
I don't think about us in terms of love
I don't think about then in terms of now
I found a way to start again somehow
I don't think about what we thought it was
Oh in terms of love

I don't think about me in terms of you
I don't think about you in terms of us
In terms of love

I don't think about then in terms of now
I found a way to start again somehow
Oh yeah yeah yeah
I don't think about us in terms of love

Come Come Tenessee Me
Tenessee Me waiting here
I'm lonely tonight but feeling alright
Why don't you come over here
Why don't you come over here

Oh Oh Tenessee Me
Tenessee Me see me loving you
See me by the fire side light
Come and see me through the night
Tenessee me through the night

If you chose the world to see
Just leave your heart in Tenessee

Plain Plain Tenessee Me
Living just a mile away
I'm nothing special but I can hold you
If you want to you can stay
Tenessee Me won't you stay

Please Please Tenessee Me
See me lookin' in your eyes
Tenessee Me wants to love
Wants to love you all my life
Let me love you all my life

There's that star the one they said we'd never reach
And just close your eyes
There's the missing moon there's the Milky Way
Heaven's straight ahead we'll be there today
Rainbows right and left sunshine everywhere
If it couldn't be baby how did we get there


Some say we'll never get it off the ground
Some say we'll never make it out of town
That someday we'll end up a world apart
And some say we're a couple of crazy kids
And some say that's exactly what they did
And I say you got to go with your heart
And baby look where we are

There's that home the one they said we'd never share
And just close your eyes
There's the picket fence there's our mailbox
Puppy on the porch and roses up the walk
Shinny minivan kids in every seat
Someday we'll look back and say it wasn't just a dream







Things around here haven't changed much
It's all pretty much the same stuff
Day after day
The only thing that keeps me goin seems to be our baby girl I'm tryin to raise
She's my life my mornin angel
Always seems to find the rainbow after the rain
Lately she's so busy growin I don't even think she knows you've gone away

She finally learned to say goodbye
She's sleepin through the night
She don't wake up cryin
And she's walkin on her own
She don't need no one holding to her hand
And I hate to admit
She's stronger than I am

She ain't crackin under pressure
First one step and then another
She goes along
And if she falls and skins her knee
She cries a while and smiles at me and just goes on
So many things that she can teach me
Full of life and so completely innocent
She still says she loves her daddy
Goes on just like nothin happened
Forgives and forgets

She finally learned to say goodbye
She's sleepin through the night
She don't wake up cryin
And she's walkin on her own
She don't need no one holding to her hand
And I hate to admit
She's stronger than I am

She's just like her old man
Stronger than I am

I’ll admit it got to me
Hearing your voice on my machine
It took all I had to just let you talk
And not pick up where we left off
Every night since your goodbye
I hit my knees and closed my eyes
And I pray that you’d come back
Too many tears washed out that bridge
You wanna cross but baby it’s too late for that
Last night would’ve been a different story
But the morning sun must’ve done something for me
‘Cause I bet I’d gone the other way
If you’d called yesterday
If you’d called yesterday
This victory runs bitter sweet
Through the heart and soul of me
But I sip my coffee and watch the sun rise
Makin’ its way to a bluer sky
Every night since your goodbye
I hit my knees and closed my eyes
And I prey that you’d come back
Too many tears washed out that bridge
You wanna cross but baby it’s too late for that
Last night would’ve been a different story
But the morning sun must’ve done something for me
‘Cause I bet I’d gone the other way
If you’d called yesterday
Last night would’ve been a different story
But the morning sun must’ve done something for me
‘Cause I bet I’d gone the other way
If you’d called yesterday
If you’d called yesterday
If you’d called yesterday

If there ever was a time
That I could use your trust in me
And if there ever was a reason
For me to get down on my knees
And if there's any way if there's any way
That you could love me anyhow
If you ever had much faith in me
I could use a little now

When I said it would suit me fine
If you were out of sight and out of mind
That wasn't me talking
That was my wounded pride
When I said I didn't want your love
And you were no one I was thinking of
Believe me baby I lied

Well I got no good excuses
But I got plenty of regrets
And I wish this was some bad dream
I could wake up and forget
'Cause you're the only one you're the only one
That I could never stand to lose
You're all I've ever wanted
Baby that's the truth

When I said it would suit me fine
If you were out of sight and out of mind
That wasn't me talking
That was my wounded pride
When I said I didn't want your love
And you were no one I was thinking of
Believe me baby I lied

Hey

When I said it would suit me fine
If you were out of sight and out of mind
That wasn't me talking
That was my wounded pride
When I said I didn't want your love
And you were no one I was thinking of
Believe me baby I lied
Believe me baby I lied

You call and wake me up the way you always do
Say you miss me and you're sorry deja vu
You push the button in the heart you know so well
The wall starts coming down then I remind myself

Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out
Everytime you say let's try again
Begging me to let you back in
Everytime I do
Everytime you lie
Everytime I cry

If only promises could just erase the past
I could open up my heart enough to take you back
But we've been down that road
Time and time again
I've learned the hard way how the story always ends

Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out
Everytime you say let's try again
Begging me to let you back in
Everytime I do
Everytime you lie
Everytime I cry

Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out
Everytime you say let's try again
Begging me to let you back in
Everytime I do
Everytime you lie
Everytime I cry

Everytime I do
Everytime you lie
Everytime I cry

I got an empty feelin'
When that moving van pulled up
It got a whole lot emptier
As I watched them fill that truck
And when they carried out your clothes
It took my breath away
Now they're headed for that bed
The thought keeps runnin' through my head

Baby maybe
We should just sleep on it tonight
And give our hearts just one more chance
To change our minds
I could be wrong but
Goodbye just don't feel right
So baby maybe
We should just sleep on it tonight

I'll pay them boys to stop right now
And leave that truck out on the curb
The tv and the phone's packed up
So we won't be disturbed
There's not a light left in this room
Just a shadow of a doubt
So let's make sure we don't give up
Before we've thought this through enough

Baby maybe
We should just sleep on it tonight
And give our hearts just one more chance
To change our minds
I could be wrong but
Goodbye just don't feel right
So baby maybe
We should just sleep on it tonight

Baby maybe
We should just sleep on it tonight
And give our hearts just one more chance
To change our minds
I could be wrong but
Goodbye just don't feel right
So baby maybe
Baby maybe
Baby maybe
We should just sleep on it
Tonight

I'm not sayin' I have all the answers
And I don't care who's right or wrong
I'm tryin' to pick up the pieces already fallen
And put them back where they belong

So slow down your horses
Stop draggin' me around
And if cryin' is the only way into your heart
Then leavin' is the only way out 

We've slammed every door in anger
And we've opened wounds we can't mend
And one night lonely is one night too many
Don't wanna wake up to one more night that won't end 

So slow down your horses
Stop draggin' me around
And if cryin' is the only way into your heart
Then leavin' is the only way out 

When late nights and long lies came knockin'
You just invited them in
And our voices got too loud for talkin'
Then my heart hit the floor
But your feet just kept walkin' 

And if cryin' is the only way you hear me hurtin'
For the lovin' that I can't live without
And if lovin' ain't the only way into your heart
Then leavin' is the only way out 

Oh leavin' is the only way out

We were as young as we were dumb
When we piled in an old pile of junk
It was one for all and all for one
A bunch of outlaws without a gun
Shootin' bad booze outta Dixie cups
Chasin' every girl that wasn't fast enough
No matter how bad the break or how bad the luck
Or how bad the day we still had us

Blood brothers closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other

Yeah brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight you cry you lie you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers

I got a scar on my cheek from a bar room brawl
Wasn't meant for me but I took the fall
It's a cowboy code it's an unwrote law
When you mess with one you gotta take us all

Blood brother's closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other

Yeah brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight you cry you lie you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers

Time can fly on by
Everything can change
Until the day we die
We'll always remain
We'll remain
Yeah yeah yeah

Blood brothers closer than you next of kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other

Yeah brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight you cry you lie you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers

Yeah yeah
Oh oh
Blood brothers

He left me cryin' late one Sunday night outside of Boulder
He said he had to find himself out on the road
I guess when love goes wrong
You've gotta learn to be strong

So I worked two jobs and I moved three times
I ended up south of Memphis workin' down in Riverside
I may not be so lucky in love
But the one thing I'm sure of

I want a man that stands beside me
Not in front of or behind me
Give me two arms that want to hold me not own me
And I'll give all the love in my heart
Stand beside me
Be true don't tell lies to me
I'm not lookin' for a fantasy
I want a man that who stands beside me

I didn't expect to see him one hot July morning
His hair was longer but his eyes were the same old blue
He said I've missed you for so long Oh baby what can I do
I said I want a man that stands beside me
Not in front of or behind me
Give me two arms that want to hold me not own me
And I'll give all the love in my heart

It's hard to tell him no when I want him so bad
But I've got to be true to my heart This time

I'm not lookin' for a fantasy
I want a man who stands beside me
I want a man
Who stands beside me
Stand beside me
Stand beside me

You've got your Texas way of walking
You've got your sexy way of talking
I let you get all under my skin
But now your welcome has worn off and
So next time you go don't come back again

Cause your train don't stop here anymore
I ain't your gas-up rest stop swinging door
You can't just walk in walk out like so many times before
I ain't your swinging door

You've got a girl in every cow-town
You think I don't know how you cat around
I let your sweet talk get my guard down
Took me a while to figure you out
But I've got you figured all out now

And your train don't stop here anymore
I ain't your gas-up rest stop swinging door
You can't just walk in walk out like so many times before
I ain't your swinging door

You'd best make up your mind
Cause if you go you ain't coming back this time

Your train don't stop here anymore
I ain't your quick stop walk up open 24
You can't just drop in drop out treat me like your candy store

Your train don't stop here anymore
I ain't your gas-up rest stop swinging door
You can't just walk in walk out like so many times before
I ain't your swinging door
I ain't your swinging door

Won't you please turn up the lights
I can't hardly see
Thank you kindly but that don't help
Maybe it's just me
It seems I've had this problem since
My baby packed up to leave

You see she used to be my sunshine
Now we're far apart
Night is fallin' in my heart
Oh the light is slowly fading
Skies are growing dark
Night is fallin' in my heart

Could you pull those curtains back
And let the morning in
What's that you say Oh is that a fact
Well it still seems mighty dim
I guess I'll just have to live this way
Unless my baby come back again

You see she used to be my sunshine
Now we're far apart
Night is fallin' in my heart
Oh the light is slowly fading
Skies are growing dark
Night is fallin' in my heart

And as the last ray of love
Slowly disappears
Alone in this endless night
I just see one thing clear

You see she used to be my sunshine
Now we're far apart
Night is fallin' in my heart
Oh the light is slowly fading
Skies are growing dark
Night is fallin' in my heart

I got a  feelin' called the blu-ues oh Lawd
Since my baby said good- bye
And I don't know what I'll do-oo-oo
All I do is sit and  sigh-igh oh Lawd
That  last long  day she said good- bye
Well  Lawd I thought I would  cry
She'll  do me she'll do you she's got that kind of lovin'
Lawd I love to hear her when she calls me
Sweet dad-ad-ad-dy  such a beautiful  dream
I hate to think it all o-o-ver
I've lost my heart it  seems
I've grown  so  used to you some- how
Well I'm  nobody's sugar- daddy now
And I'm  lo-on-lonesome 
I got the Lovesick  Blu-ues

Well I'm in  love I'm in love with a  beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with  me
Well I'm in  love I'm in love with a  beautiful gal
But  she don't care about me
Lawd I tried and I tried to keep her satisfied
But she  just wouldn't stay
So  now that she is lea-eav-in'
This is all I can  say

Oh my love what have I done
Oh my love what have I done

I shot an arrow in your heart that
I can't take back
When I said You were my first love
But you are not my last

For far too long I hid my face
I fed off your forgiving grace
Well I know your pride it must've
Took a beating
When I used your love to rob your freedom
What have I done

Oh what have I done
What have I done
There's a hurt in me I don't understand
What have I done
What have I done
I broke the sweetest heart of the only one
That's ever loved me

I don't know what I've become
I need to get back to where I'm from
I'm gonna smash every mirror in this empty house
'Cause like you I don't wanna see myself

Oh what have I done
What have I done
There's a hurt in me I don't understand
What have I done
What have I done
I broke the sweetest heart of the only one
That's ever loved me

I hope you find someone new
Someone who's worthy of you
Oh when you look back and I know you will
I hope you find a little good in me still
'Cause I loved you enough to let you
I'll always regret
I hope you know
What I have done

Oh what have I done
What have I done
There's a hurt in me I don't understand
What have I done
What have I done
I broke the sweetest heart of the only one
That's ever loved me

Oh my love what have I done
Oh my love what have I done

I was always the crazy one
I broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the 50 yard line
You were always the perfect one
And the valadictorian so
Under your number I wrote call for a good time

I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

How do you like me now
How do you like me now
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy 
Standin here today
I couldnt make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio 
How do you like me now

When I took off to Tennessee 
I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money girl
Aint it a cruel and funny world
He took your dreams and tore them apart

He never comes home 
And youre always alone
And your kids hear you cryin down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringin
Who could that be singin
Its me baby with your wake up call

How do you like me now
How do you like me now
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy 
Standin here today
I couldnt make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio 
How do you like me now

Tell me baby
I will preach on

My married friends keep asking
When I'll settle down
They tell me time is passing
And there's not too many good ones still around
I tell them I am not afraid to be alone
And there's no need to rush into something wrong

So I'm not gonna worry
No I'm in no hurry
It's in the hands of fate there's nothing I can do
And it might be tomorrow
Or the one that follows
Got the rest of my life to look forward to
'Cause every day is one day closer to you

You might be in Montana
Living in the hills
Or you might be in Virginia
Working in a mill
All I know is that I haven't found you yet
And who knows maybe we've already met

So I'm not gonna worry
No I'm in no hurry
It's in the hands of fate there's nothing I can do
And it might be tomorrow
Or the one that follows
Got the rest of my life to look forward to
'Cause every day is one day closer to you

Oh every day I pray that God will keep you safe
'Cause I know you're out there somewhere

So I'm not gonna worry
No I'm in no hurry
It's in the hands of fate there's nothing I can do
And it might be tomorrow
Or the one that follows
Got the rest of my life to look forward to
'Cause every day is one day closer
Yeah every day is one day closer
Every day is one day closer to you yeah

You got what it takes you can win

You got what it takes you can win
Today is your day to begin
Don't give up here don't you quit
The moment is now this is it
I know that you can then you will
Get to the top of the hill
Part of the fun is the climb
You just gotta make up your mind

That today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today today today today

When somebody throws sticks and stones
All they can break are your bones
And life's gonna kick you around
Then kick you again when you're down

But today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today today today today

Life's gonna kick
It's gonna kick you around
It's gonna kick you down

Brush yourself up no regrets
This is as good as it gets
Don't expect more or less
Just go out and give it your best

Today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today today today today

Today is your day

I ain't complainin'
But I'm tired so I'm just sayin'
What I think
And if we're being honest
Than honestly I think I need a drink

My baby's growin' up
She think's she's fallin' all in love
And that I hate her
At seventeen she's just like me when I was seventeen
So I don't blame her


Do do do do 
Do do do do
What are we gonna do 
Do do do do
Do do do do
What are we gonna do about it 


Remember when we use to be
Everything they ever need
We had them believing we were cool
It's like it happened over night
We're always wrong their always right
We use to be the one's breakin' the rules
Now we're just mothers we're just fathers of
Teenage Daughters

She rolls her eye's when I'm funny
But she's sweet when she wants money and her freedom
Oh my god she's got a car
Swears they wont go far
And i wish i believed 'em





Their beautiful wild and free
Everything we wish we could be
But their still crazy
Oh you know the make us crazy



Yeah Teenage Daughters

I ain't complainin'
But I'm just tired so I'm sayin'
What I think
If we're being honest
Than honestly I think I need a drink

Confetti fallin' from the sky
My hometown on the 4th of July
A midnight snow on Christmas Eve
Like standin' up for what you believe


That's how I feel when I'm with you
That's how I feel when I'm with you
That's how I feel
That's how I feel when I'm with you

Your lucky coat the first day of fall
When you wake up laughin' just because
An old church door that stays wide open
A perfect heart that's never been broken



That's how I feel when I'm with you
Every day there's something new
To cry about to laugh about
Those moments I can't live without
That's how I feel
That's how I feel
When I'm with you

When you walk into the edge of those dark and lonely woods
And when I ask How was your day 
You answer Not so good
And when nothing seems to be working out quite the way it should
I will shine the light
When the skies up above you fill with gray and stormy clouds
And there's not a single face you know in the maddening crowd
When you know that you will make your way but you just can't see how
I will shine the light
I will shine the light
I will shine the light
I will hold you in my arms until everything's alright
I will shine the light
And when your worries they won't let you sleep and rob you of your days
And you've looked in all directions but you still can't find your way
Or when you just need someone to remind you that it's all gonna be okay
I will shine the light
I will shine the light
I will shine the light
When you're staring down your demons waiting in your darkest night
I will shine the light
Sometimes we jump into the great unknown
Some roads we're on we'll have to walk alone
But waiting there in the end is a heart that calls you a friend
That's me
Clapping the loudest welcoming you home
So when your heart is heavy like a stone
From carrying it's load
And you look into the mirror and see someone you don't know
Or when the shadows are closing in on you like a hand around your throat
I will shine the light
I will shine the light
I will shine the light
When you've given into your fear
When you've lost your will to fight
Let me know that I can do
Let me try to make it right
And I will shine the light
I will shine the light

It's been so long
I should be used to this by now
Loneliness that keeps coming back around
The moon on my window casts a different light
On all these memories that keep me up tonight

Hey I know just what I need
That's you and in a hurry
If I got on the road right now
I'd see you at four thirty

Hey I think I have about
Sixty miles of gasoline left in my car
There's an all night truck stop
Yeah I bet I could get that far
I can close my eyes and smell coffee in the air
I'll fill my cup if you'll wait up
I'll soon be there

Hey I'm letting go
So baby don't you worry
Wheels on ground
I won't slow down
I'll see you at four thirty
Hey Iyeah

Hey I won't allow my mind
To talk me out of this
Past every exit sign
Cause that's the way it is

Hey I'm letting go
So baby don't you worry
Wheels on ground
I won't slow down
I'll see you yeah
Hey I know just what I need
That's you and in a hurry
Oh wheels on ground I won't slow down
I'll see you at four thirty

When you lose somethin
It’s all that you want back
You’re waitin patiently
But it don’t work like that

When you lose someone
The first thing that goes through your head
Is if you run fast enough
You just might catch up
But it don’t work like that


You just gotta watch it fly
Stand there on the side lines
Go on and swallow your pride
You know its gonna be alright
Wish it well and close your eyes
With a kiss goodbye

Well the hardest part
Ya it hurts so bad
Is when she spreads her wings
But it’d be a selfish thing
To try and hold her back
But it don’t work like that


You just gotta watch it fly
Stand there on the side lines
Go on and swallow your pride
You know its gonna be alright
Wish it well and close your eyes
With a kiss goodbye

When you lose something
It’s all that you want back


You just gotta watch it fly
Stand there on the side lines
Go on and swallow your pride
You know its gonna be alright
Wish it well and close your eyes
With a kiss goodbye

Like a kiss goodbye

One good love
Erases all the bitter tears on an empty dance hall
All those lonely nights when she never called
It just don't seem so tragic after all
With one good love

One good love
And daddy's hands were strong and fair
And a momma understands because she's been there
And all mistakes were just because they cared so much
With one good love


One good love
You bless all my memories
You soften the fall of my tears
And in my arms you're more than enough
You're one good love

Hey you're one good love
Yeah you're one good love



One good love 
And born again means more than pass the plate and bow your head
Yes you bury what needs burying you raise it from the dead
The very best you heal the brokeness give grace to everyone
With one good love

Yeah oh one good love
Hey hey one good love
Yeah I'll give you one good love
Oh give me one good love now love yeah
ooooooo yeah
Lord I feel born again yeah
You got to give me one good love now
One good love

I could love you
Baby if you want me to
I could go and fall for you
And never even try hey hey

I could let you in
Baby where nobody’s been
Yeah I’m ready and willing
To give this love a try hey hey


You’re the reason why
Baby you’re the only reason why
Don’t wanna say goodnight
Keep kissing me don’t wanna say goodnight
Yeah it feels so right
Everything is gonna be alright
You’re the reason why hey hey
You’re the reason why hey hey

You’re in my head
Like a song I can’t forget
Wanna hear it over again
And again hey hey

Come on and take my hand
I’m ready and willing
Over and over again

Oh I said a little prayer tonight
Before I came on stage
As I came walkin' past the drivers
And the locals on the union wage
I asked the good Lord up in heaven
Let me treat the music right
Then I prayed that Detroit
Goes wild tonight

Seven pickers and all our gear in a rental van
Playin' music never sleepin' and workin' on a neon tan
We played The Barn down in Sanford Florida
For Bev Roberts out in Camden Park
We plugged it in up east at Bull Run
And the place went dark

Back when the old stuff was new
Back before the buses and the
Hard workin' boys in the crew
asIt was one big party
But the business called it payin' our dues
Back when the old stuff was new

Oh the stories we could tell
If it weren't for the code of the road
About The Buckboard Bear Creek Cowboys and the Grizzly Rose
You know the weather turned bad in Scottsdale
A tornado nearly stole the show
We just danced in the rain and listened to the thunder roll

Back when the old stuff was new
Hats off to the KC Opry and ellA GURU'S
It was one big party
Uncle Joe you know we owe it to you
Back when the old stuff was new

No rules young fools comin' from the old school
Takin' on the world alone
Next date can't wait tearin' up the interstate
Every place we played was home
Balls out no doubt this is what it's all about
Beggin' for a place to play
Swingin' with our low friends
Prayin' that it never ends
Wouldn't trade a single day

Back when the old stuff was new
Back before the buses and the
Hard workin' boys in the crew
It was one big party
But the paper's called it payin' our dues
Back when the old stuff was new

Hey it's still one big party
You can call it whatever you choose
You make me feel like the old stuff is new

Ask me how much you mean to me
And I wouldn't even know where to start
Ask if this love runs deep in me
And you won't find a deeper love in any heart

You could say you couldn't live one day without me
You could say all of your thoughts are about me
You could think no other love could be as strong
But you'd be wrong
You'd be wrong

If you say that you love me
More than anybody
Than anyone's ever been loved before
As much as you love me
Baby I'll still love you
Baby I'll still love you more
I'll still love you more

Ask me just what I'd do for you
And I'll tell you I would do anything
Ask if this heart beats true for you
And I'll show you a truer heart could never be

You could say there's not a star that you won't bring me
You could say there'll be no day that you won't need me
You could think no other love could last as long
But you'd be wrong
You'd be wrong

If you say that you love me
More than anybody
Than anyone's ever been loved before
As much as you love me
Baby I'll still love you
Baby I'll still love you more
I'll still love you more

And for every kiss
I'll kiss you back a hundred times
And for everything you do
I'll just do more
And for all the love you give
I'll give you so much back you'll see
Got so much love for you inside

If you say that you love me
More than anybody
Than anyone's ever been loved before
As much as you love me
Baby I'll still love you
Baby I'll still love you more
I'll still love you more

If you say that you love me
More than anybody
Than anyone's ever been loved before
No matter how much you love me
Baby I'll still love you
Baby I'll still love you more yeah
I'll still love you more

Baby don't turn out the light
I wanna see you look at me
Whisper only truth tonight
Not just promises and empty fantasies

I don't need a bed of roses
'Cause roses wither away
All I really need is honesty
From someone with a strong heart
A gentle hand
Who'll take me as I am

Baby I need for you to know
Just exactly how I feel
Fiery passions come and go
I'd trade a million pretty words
For one touch that is real

I don't need a bed of roses
'Cause roses wither away
All I really need is honesty
From someone with a strong heart
A gentle hand
Who'll take me as I am

From someone with a strong heart
A gentle hand
Who'll take me as I am

I got eyes in the back of my head
Your halo's turnin' red
Foolin' around knockin' me off my cloud
They're talking about your mischievous ways
Boy it's painted all over your face
Stealin' a kiss mysterious whispers
A thorn in my pride
I'm still by your side but

One day I'm walking away
The tide is gonna turn I'm gonna find my place
Give me a reason to stay
I want to be your lover
Baby but you can't behave

Remember the days and the Hollywood nights
What happened to paradise
Stolen away and I can't replace it now
'cause rumors are flying
That I can't avoid

Are they true or am I paranoid
Livin' like this it's drivin' me crazy
So make up your mind
You're running out of time



Ease all of my worries
Please don't make me play the fool
Baby won't you hurry
You don't know what you're gonna lose



Morning number 32 waking up without you
Mama's on the telephone
She says she's got a plan
She knows a nice young man
Honey if I come back home

Everybody knows everybody knows
Everybody knows what to do about my misery
Everybody but me

Well all the girls at work say just forget the jerk
I feel better now
Even my preacher cares said all I need is prayer
And everything will just work out

Everybody knows everybody knows
Everybody knows what to do about my misery
Everybody but me

Everybody knows everybody knows
Everybody knows what to do about my misery
Yeah everybody but me

Well I don't want a shrink
Don't even want a drink
Give me some chocolate and a magazine
I'll learn to live without you
Don't want to talk about you
But I can't even walk down the street

Everybody knows everybody knows
Everybody knows what to do about my misery
Everybody but me

She says most men her age want younger women
She thinks her self esteem's not quite itself any more
But she sees herself as more than what the mirror shows
Why that's so important heaven only knows
When the important part for her is
Souls and heart's sayin':

Dreams of sharin' a life and a home
Dreams 
Of never ever bein' alone again
Dreams 
Not even diamonds just a little gold
Someone there to hold her hand when she gets old
Dreams the kind you know will never end
Forever lovers and forever friends
Someone really there to love and care and share 
Dreams

She swears she won't divorce her time
She swears the more she knows about love the harder it is to find
Her perfect picture of her white horse prince
Is now dependent dirty and promises
Someone kind and brave
Soemone not afraid of:

Dreams 
Of never ever bein' alone again
Dreams 
Not even diamonds just a little gold
Someone there to hold her hand when she gets old
Dreams the kind you know will never end
Forever lovers and forever friends
Someone really there to love and care and share 
Dreams

Oh Dreams the kind you know will never end
Forever lovers forever friends
Someone really there to love and care and share 
Dreams

She says most men her age want younger women

Tone-deaf Tone-deaf

You say you're gun-shy
I say you're spineless
You think you're pensive
I I think you're mindless
Such a busy little drone
That your heart beats in monotone
So loud you can't hear me
Repetion's what you need


Get out of my air get off of my cloud
Get out of my hair get off of my couch
Get off of my lips get out of my light
Let me give you a tip get out of my sight
Get off of your knees get out of my face
Get out of my sleep get out of my space
How long do I have to show and tell scream and yell
Get over yourself

You say you're complicated
I say too dramatic
You think I underrate you
I think I've finally had it
With you never having time
Cause half the time you spend 
Designing brilliant tragedies
And it's becomming your disease




Won't let you unnerve me
You try to string me like a pearl
Won't let you deserve me
And toss me from your tilt-o-whirl
And even if I kiss the dirt you're going to see me 
How I don't hurt
And I don't hurt



Get over yourself
Get over yourself



You turn around
Then you ask me behind tears of doubt
Just what do I see in you
Please don't cry
I know sometimes it seems we barely get by
But you don't see how much you do
To get me through

When the world is cold
And I need a friend to hold
You give me love
You give me love
And when my hope is gone
And I feel I can't go on
You pick me up
You give me love
You give me love

I apologize
If I never told you what you are in my eyes
Oh baby let me tell you now
Every day
Looks sweeter knowing you'll be there in every way
Now how can you say that's not enough

'Cause when the world is cold
And I need a friend to hold
You give me love
You give me love
And when my hope is gone
And it feels I can't go on
You pick me up
You give me love

You give me

Everything my heart desires
Morning sun and midnight fires
Someone there to share my dreams
With you I have everything

When the world is cold
And I need a friend to hold
You give me love
You give me love
And when my hope is gone
And I feel I can't go on
You pick me up
You give me love
You give me love

Yeah when my world is cold
And I need a friend to hold me
You give me love
You give me love
And when my hope is gone
And I feel I can't go on
You pick me up
You give me love

Sometimes good intentions
Don't come across so well

Get me analyzing everything that
aint' worth thinking 'bout
Just cause I ain't lived through
The same hand that was dealt to you
Doesn't make me any less
Or make any more of you

I wouldn't trade my best day
So you could validate
All your fears

And if I've only got one shot
Won't waste it on a shadow box
I'll stand right here


It's all talk talk talk
Talkin' in the wind
It only slows you down
If you start listenin'
And it's a whole lot harder to shine Than undermine
Yeah undermine

First mile is always harder
When you're leaving what you know
Won't blame you if you stay here
Waving to me as I go
Always wished the best for you
Thought that you would see me through my wildest dreams
Yeah the ones you thought I'd never make

Still you would trade your best day
Just to have your way
All these years
And if you only had one shot
Maybe all this talk
Would disappear



It's a whole lot harder to shine
Yeah it's a whole lite harder to shine Than undermine
Yeah undermine

Sometimes good intentions
Don't come across so well

Thought we had a good thing baby
You pulled the wool over my eyes
Should've seen it coming baby
Now all I see is a cool love dying
Honey I don't want to hold you down
Why you gotta own the lock and the key
Oh tell me baby
Good things just don't come around
And you can't have them for free
No not me
You've been a river of give
And an ocean of take
Darlin' for heaven's sake

You've got me up and down and in between
Acting nice then being real mean
Hey
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back
Who could deal with that
You say you want to work it out boy
Tell me what's in it for me

You're living in your own world
You act like I'm just passing through
Oh yeah
Don't you want to be happy
Don't you know how good I could be
Seems everybody's telling you something
That they know you just want to hear
Oh but you ain't gonna hear it from me
You've been a valley of love
And a mountain of need
Baby it's time you see

You've got me up and down and in between
Acting nice then being real mean
Hey
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back
Who could deal with that
You say you want to work it out boy
Tell me what's in it for me

Up and down and in between
Acting nice then being real mean
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back
Who could deal with that
You say you want to work it out boy
Tell me what's in it for me

You've been a river of give and a mountain of take
Darlin' for Heaven's sake

You've got me up and down and in between
Acting nice then being real mean
Hey
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back
Who could deal with that
You say you want to work it out boy
Tell me what's in it for me

Up and down and in between
Acting nice then being real mean
Hey
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back
Who could deal with that
You say you want to work it out boy
Tell me what's in it for me
Oh in it for me
What's in it for me
What's in it for me

Boy there's a few things you need to know about me
Before you let your sweet heart get in too deep
A white picket fence don't feel like home
Don't wanna rock I need a rolling stone
You wanna hold me
Baby just set me free


I'm a traveling circus train
Spinning weathervane
Going where the wind blows yeah
I was born to chase the sun
Some horses gotta run
Yeah I'm always gonna be
A little bit gypsy

Someday hey maybe I'll settle down
But it sure ain't anytime close to now
So much that I might miss you
Sit still for a single minute
I got a life and I'm going to live it
The only way I know how



I don't know where I'm headed to
I just know I wanna go with you
Do you want to go too



A little bit gypsy

My cousin's gettin' married at the Methodist church
That's why I stayed home from work
I'm supposed to hold the flowers
When the new bride kisses the groom
That's what I'm supposed to do
So what are we doin' with the windows rolled down
Twenty five passionate miles from town
I love her like a sister baby but to tell the truth
I'd rather ride around with you

The guy she's gonna marry's got money to burn
His daddy's a partner in some big law firm
Yeah that's how they're goin'
To Hawaii on their honeymoon
First class to Honolulu
She ain't never even set foot on a jet
I'm a little bit jealous I confess
I'd like to fly to Hawaii
But honey if I had to choose
I'd rather ride around with you

I don't care where this road goes
No I don't wanna turn around
Let go of the wheel feel the wind blow
Don't even think about slowin' down

They're tyin' tin cans to the back of the car
Wonderin' where in the world we are
The preacher's done prayin'
And the couple's done sayin' I do
That could be me and you
There's way too many decisions to make
The length of the dress
The layers on the cake
One of these days I might get married too
But I'd rather ride around with you

I'd rather ride around with you
I'd rather ride around with you

You don't know what you do
When you look at me that way
You don't how my heart breaks
Everytime you say my name
You don't see all the tears
That I cry in the dark
You don't hear how I pray
That you're safe when we're apart
Everytime we kiss you don't know
How you steal a piece of my soul

You don't know how it feels
To be the one who loves the most
How hard it is not to beg you to stay
Then watch you go
Oh you say it's all in my head
But to me it seems so real
No you don't know how it feels
You might think you do
But you don't
Hey

And everytime we kiss you don't know
How you steal a piece of my soul

You don't know how it feels
To be the one who loves the most
How hard it is not to beg you to stay
Then watch you go
Oh you say it's all in my head
But to me it seems so real
No you don't know it feels
You might think you do
But you don't
No you don't know how it feels
You might think you do
But you don't

You look like Georgia
On a cool summer day
Your smile hits me like a breeze blowing off the lake
You talk like Kansas
You can see to the horizon
There's no place for the words to hide
Cause you mean what you say
Mean what you say


Got a heart like Indiana
Laugh like Louisiana
Take me down to Alabama
Show me some of that laid back vibe
Kissin' while we fishing in the moonlight
Shine like California
High like an Arizona noontime baby when you're all mine
Anywhere anyplace I go
You feel like home to me
You feel like home to me

Love's taken me across the map
All the way to hell and back
Gave everything I had
Lost my mind a couple times
Met you and I was sure
I found the center of the universe
Hit the interstate fast now
I'm never looking back no
Lookin' back lookin' back oh no


Got a heart like Indiana
Laugh like Louisiana
Take me down to Alabama
Show me some of that laid back vibe
Kissin' while we fishing in the moonlight
Shine like California
High like an Arizona noontime baby when you're all mine
Anywhere anyplace I go
You feel like home to me
You feel like home to me

You feel like home


Got a heart like Indiana
Laugh like Louisiana
Take me down to Alabama
Show me some of that laid back vibe
Kissin' while we fishing in the moonlight
Shine like California
High like an Arizona noontime baby when you're all mine
Anywhere anyplace I go
You feel like home to me
You feel like home to me

You feel like home
You feel like home to me

Heaven heartache and the power of love

They say up in Heaven the streets are gold
Once you get past the Pearly Gates
And the angels are singin'
At the top of a dove white staircase

And I say heartache can burn you down like hell
Leave you beggin' Baby please don't go
'Til you're scrapin' rock bottom
And cryin' in a deep dark hole

Oh and love can make you fly like a rocket
Put you on top of the world

I'm talkin' 'bout
Heaven is where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache that's where I've been
Heaven heartache and the power of love

Well the preacher says when your time is up
You take a chariot to the Lord
Well I'm hopin' my chariot's
A torch red Thunderbird Ford

And my old flame said
I hate to break it to you darlin'
I was born the leavin' kind
Left me standin' in the dark
Cryin' Why baby why baby why

Oh but real love's got me back in the saddle
Shoutin' amen again

That's what I know about
Heaven is where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache that's where I've been
Heaven heartache and the power of love

I gotta keep lovin' and livin'
And learnin' and burnin'
Movin' on down the road

Heaven is where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache that's where I've been
Heaven heartache and the power of

Heaven it's where I hope I'm goin'
Heartache that's where I've been
Heaven heartache and the power of love

Heartache oh that's where I've been
Heaven that's where I hope I'm goin'

Showboat coming up the river
See her lanterns flicker in the gentle breeze
I can hear the crickets singing in the evening
Old Dixie Lily moving past the cypress trees

My little boat she rocks easy
I've been catching catfish in the creek all day
Oh and I've never seen ladies like those on the big boats
Must be fancy breeding lets you live that way

Dixie Lily chugging like a grand old lady
Paddles hitting home in the noonday sun
Ploughing through the water with your whistles blowing
Down from Louisiana on the Vicksburg run

Papa says that I'm a dreamer
Says them skeetas bit me one too many times
Oh but I never get lonesome living on the river
Watching old Lily leave the world behind

I lay down to sleep at night until the craving for you wakes me up
I reach out to grab you gotta have you yell until I had enough
And you got me now yea yea
And you got me now

We can lock the world outside close my eyes give in and then we'll fly
You're a secret that I'm gonna try to keep until the day I die
And you got me now aah aah
And you got me now

You always want me you run straight for me
Down the mountain like a raging fire
And the storm is comin' I can hear the warning
I know you're a lie
But you got me now yea
Oh oh you got me now

I'm gettin' good at lettin' these excuses roll so easy off my tongue
And you're gettin' good at makin' me feel nothin' while I'm hurting everyone
But you got me now yea yea
You got me now

You always want me you run straight for me
Down the mountain like a raging fire
And the storm is comin' I can hear the warning
I know you're a lie
But you got me now
Ooh you got me now

I lay down to sleep at night until the craving for you wakes me up


Good Lord willing and the creek don't rise
My baby's got a song to sing
While the crickets and the train whistle harmonize
Doing that front porch thing
Clanging out banging out a feel-good tune
Strumming on my old 6 string
Sure can kill these country blues
Doing that front porch thing

Work's been slow money's been tight
But that's alright honey that's alright
Sometimes you won't but sometimes you will
And when she do what she do it's a doggone thrill


Good Lord willing and the creek don't rise
My baby's got a song to sing
While the crickets and the train whistle harmonize
Doing that front porch thing
Clanging out banging out a feel good tune
Strumming on my old 6 string
Sure can kill these country blues
Doing that front porch thing

When the moon comes up we sit down
And the chains start creaking
Making swinging sounds
Fall in love all over again
Having so much fun it oughta be a sin



When we're doing that front porch thing
When we're doing that front porch thing
Doing that front porch thing

Well he used to be mine
Not so very long ago
I was crazy
To ever let him get away
But girl you should know better
Then to go braggin' in my face
So forgive me
For what I'm 'bout to say

Candle light and long stem roses
And how you're fallin' head over heels
In love so what big deal

The first ten times that you told me

Candle light and long stem roses
And how you're fallin' head over heels

Big Deal

Shut up train I’m trying to sleep
Can’t you show me a little sympathy
This is the only time I can get any peace
So shut up train I’m tryin to sleep


Every time the front door shakes
Every time I hear the breaks
And that long whistle cryin through the night
I’m reminded of the way I feel
Just like that cold black steel
Gettin crushed by your wheels tonight
I don’t need no more pain so shut up train

I hope you’re happy now I am wide awake
Now I gotta deal with every ounce of this heartache
Why your moving on I’m stuck in this place
It’s all your fault so shut up train


Every time the front door shakes
Every time I hear the breaks
And that long whistle cryin through the night
I’m reminded of the way I feel
Just like that cold black steal
Gettin crushed by your wheels tonight
I can’t take no more pain so shut up train

Shut up train stop rubbin it in
You’ve made your point

You’re all
Why don’t you shut up train go on and shut up train
You’re all
Oh shut up train
You’re all

Shut up train

You feel out of breath used up and broken down
Just like shattered glass in pieces on the ground
Some days you wanna scream but you can't make a sound
But your not alone
Here comes another day here comes another fight
You'd rather give it up then give it one more try
Cause no one understands the way you feel inside
But your not alone

Right now it feels like the end of the world
All your battles are lost
You've been cheated mistreated
Just when you think that you can't hold on any longer
Hold on a little bit longer
Trust me you'll see
You'll be so much STRONGER

It's only temporarily but it feel like your stuck
Like no wishing well but it will change your luck
They say when one door closes another opens up
You walk right through yeah you know what to do

Right now it feels like the end of the world
All your battles are lost
You've been cheated mistreated
Just when you think that you can't hold on any longer
Hold on a little bit longer
Trust me you'll see
You'll be so much STRONGER

You'll might have to bend but you're not gonna break
Wipe the tears from your eyes and the fear off your face
You know deep down inside you've got what takes

Right now it feels like the end of the world
All your battles are lost
You've been cheated mistreated
Just when you think that you can't hold on any longer
Hold on a little bit longer
Trust me you'll see

You'll be so much STRONGER 

I'm afraid to go up into the second floor
If you wanted to work it out why'd you lock the door
I thought I was good at loving you
But our light went out when you wanted it to
I wish you the best I'm headed west
it's all I know to do

I will fall I will fall if you come around
Just when I think my heart break has settled down
I will fall I will fall if you come around

When we said goodbye it was forever
And I spent the last year piecing my life together
Just when I think I've let you go
Your song's playing on the radio
And just like that it rushes back
every part of you

I will fall I will fall if you come around
Just when I think my heart break has settled down
I will fall I will fall if you come around

Oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh

I will fall I will fall if you come around
Just when I think my heart break has settled down

I will fall I will fall if you come around
Just when I think my heart break has settled down
I will fall I will fall if you come around

No love can survive for long like this
When you're standing' on a bridge that's always burnin'
Maybe it's just time to walk away
If you're tryin' to find a reason
Tryin' to find a reason to stay

I don't know how long this pain will last
All I know is it can't go on forever
Isn't this just pointless anyway
If you're tryin' to find a reason to stay

It's hard to admit it what we know inside
We've tried everything everything but goodbye
Say goodbye

If your heart has nothin' left to give
If your world feels like it's just stopped turnin'
Maybe that says all there is to say
If you're tryin' to find a reason to stay

It's hard to admit it what we know inside
We've tried everything everything but goodbye

Maybe it's just time to walk away
If you're tryin' to find a reason
Tryin' to find a reason to stay
Baby it's just time to walk away
If you're tryin' to find a reason to stay

I'm a leaf on the river
Fallen from the tall oak tree
Drifting down this moving stream
Wherever this life carries me
I'm a tumbleweed
In the desert wind
Just tumblin' while
The sun's shinin'
I have no boundaries
Call me a gypsy


I'm restless
Just ramblin'
What do you do where do you go
When nowhere feels like home
I'm restless
Am I an angel fallen from heaven's grace
Oh it feels like that some days and I can't find my place
I guess God just made some of us
To live and die by highway dust
Guess I just have to trust
On the days I'm crawlin'
This is my callin'



Oh to hold somebody close that cares
Oh to finally find some roots somewhere
I know someday I'll find that it's out there
But until then I'll just keep movin'
What do you do where do you go
When nowhere feels like home
I'm restless

I've never seen two people in my life
More determined to ignore the obvious
We better stop thinking
Let our hearts start doing the talking

You'd have to be stone deaf dumb and blind
Not to see what's going on with us
So let's jump in
And get over our fear of fallin'
'Cause what we got here

Is a powerful thing
It's a powerful thing
More than three words
And a diamond ring
It can open up the heavens
Make the angels sing
Our love baby is a powerful thing

We started out strangers on a two-way street
Neither one of us lookin' to fall in love
But we don't need us a map
To know we're headed in that direction

Well it's out of our hands
And over our heads
It's something that's bigger than both of us
Turnin' back now's completely out of the question
'Cause what we got here

Is a powerful thing
It's a powerful thing
More than three words
And a diamond ring
It can open up the heavens
Make the angels sing
Our love baby is a powerful thing

Stronger than the force of a driving wind
Hotter than a forest fire
There never has been and there never will be
Nothing like the power of you and me yeah

It's a powerful thing
It's a powerful thing
More than three words
And a diamond ring
It can open up the heavens
Make the angels sing
Our love baby is a powerful thing

It's a powerful thing
It's a powerful thing
More than three words
And a diamond ring
It can open up the heavens
Make the angels sing
Our love baby is a powerful thing

It's all around you now but you don't know it 
It's tugging at your heart but you don't show it
It's just a matter of time
It's gonna hit you right between the eyes
You'll wake up in the middle of the night
I'll be the only thing on your mind
Won't be able to shake it loose
When love gets a hold of you
Before you have your first cup of coffee
You're gonna pick up the phone and call me
Won't believe what you say and do
When love gets a hold of you
Cause it's gonna be written all over your face
All your friends gonna tell you how much you've changed
Feeling things that you can't deny
Going crazy and you don't know why
You'll wake up in the middle of the night
I'll be the only thing on your mind
Won't be able to shake it loose
When love gets a hold of you
Before you have your first cup of coffee
You're gonna pick up the phone and call me
Won't believe what you say and do
When love gets a hold of you
It gets a hold of you
It's just a matter of time
It's gonna hit you right between the eyes
You're driving home at the end of the day
You'll find yourself coming by my place
Yeah you always have a good excuse
When love gets a hold of you
Once you're standing inside my door
Won't remember what you came here for
Can't control what you say and do
When love gets a hold of you
Yeah gets a hold of you
Gets a hold of you
Gets a hold of you
Oh it gets a hold of you

Teenage girl much too young
Unprepared for what's to come
A baby changes everything

Not a ring
On her hand
All her dreams and all her plans
A baby changes everything 

The man she loves she's never touched
How will she Keep his trust
A baby changes everything 

And she cries oh she cries

She has to leave go far away
Heaven knows she can't stay
A baby changes everything

She can feel it's coming soon
There's no place there's no room
A baby changes everything 

And she cries and she cries O she cries

Shepherds all gather 'round
Up above a star shines down

Choir of Angels say
Glory to the newborn king
A baby changes everything 
Everything everything every day
Hallelujah 

My whole life is turned around
I was lost but now I'm found
A baby changes everything 

There's not a lot of things to do 
I wouldn't rather do with you 
Guess I'm funny that way 
 
Lately I just sit and stare 
I talk to people who aren't there 
To get through one night a day 
One night a day 
One step away 

From leavin' you behind 
I sit up with the radio 
Sing along with the ones I know 
To get through one night a day 
One night a day 
One step away 

From leavin' you behind 
I'm callin' every friend I've had 
Wake 'em up and make 'em mad 
Let 'em know that I'm OK 
I used to sit and talk to you 
They're all just a substitute 
To get through one night a day 
One night a day 
One step away 

From leavin' you behind 
I stay up with the late late show 
Just another way I know 
To get through one night a day 
To get through one night a day

Hey girl it's me i just called to tell you hi
Call me when you get this
Haven't talked lately so hard to find the time
Give the boys a big kiss
Tell them that I miss them
By the way I miss you too

I was thinking just today
About how we used to play
Barbie dolls and make-up
Tea parties dress up
I remember how we'd fight
We made up and laughed all night
Wish we were kids again
My sister my friend

Oh yeah before I forget I met someone
I think I really like him
I was wondering if I'm jumping the gun
By going out on a limb
And invite him home for Christmas
To meet the family

Seem like just yesterday
You brought home old what's his name
He had been drinking
What were you thinking
After dinner he passed out
We can laugh about it now
We've learned a lot since then
My sister my friend

Do you think you could come and see me sometime soon
We could just hang out like we used to
It's late and I should go
But I can't hang up the phone
Until I tell you
What I don't tell you enough
Even though at times it seemed
We were more like enemies
I'd do it all again
My sister my friend

Wake up ever' mornin'
Heart's full of pain
Looked out the window
And it's pourin' down with rain
And I cried baby oh baby
Don't ever leave me again

I miss your lovin'
Your kisses too
Ain't nothin' on earth
I wouldn't do for you
And I cried baby oh baby
Don't ever leave me again

When rain starts fallin'
And I start callin'
Oh baby how I love you
My heart is cryin'
I feel like dyin'

Baby you know
I want you so
Tell me that you're mine
'Til the end of time
And I cried baby oh baby
Don't ever leave me again no
Don't ever leave me again

When rain starts fallin'
And I start callin'
Oh baby how I love you
My heart is cryin'
I feel like dyin'

Baby you know
I want you so
Tell me that you're mine
'Til the end of time
And I cried baby oh baby
Don't ever leave me again no
Don't ever leave me again

Girl you are my kind of lover
I'm still amazed that we found one another
Cause I'm just a man selfish and proud
You could have been gone but you're standing here now
I know I don't say it enough
But I long for your body and I live for your touch
All the moments when its just you and me
Right where I know I should be

Cause you save me baby
From myself
Can I be saved
Only time will tell
You're the difference
Between luck and love
Hit me when I wasn't looking at all
Love like a cannonball
Tear down the wall love like a cannonball

Tonight well I said what I said
I had too much to drink and went out of my head
And I'm sorry and ill give up the fight
So lets lay down together and get through the night
Closer and closer right by my side
Here in the dark where theres nothing to hide
Well spend a lifetime under these covers 
Theres so much of you that I have yet to discover

Cause you save me baby
From myself
Can I be saved
Only time will tell
You're the difference
Between luck and love
Hit me when I wasn't looking at all
Love like a cannonball
Tear down the wall love like a cannonball


There's a melody in my head
And I ain't stopped hummin' it since I saw your face
There's a feeling I can't forget 
T started with you kissing me that way
And there's no end in sight
Like an Oklahoma wheat field blowin'
You've got my heart in motion and I'm gone
I'm the pinks and you're the reds
Just like this sunset we belong
And there's no end in sight

How high is the sky
How long is time
With you it's how I'm spending mine
Like there is no end in sight
I wanna laugh
I wanna live
I'm gonna love you like there is like there is no end in sight

So kick your shoes off stay awhile
Ain't nothing here but stars for miles and me
We're standing on the edge of something
Not afraid of jumpin' in deep
And there's no end in sight



I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you



I'm gonna love you like there is no end in sight
I'm gonna love you like there's no end in sight 

There's a melody in my head 
And I ain't stop hummin' it since I saw your face

I'd rather live a life of lies and fantasy
Than to face the truth and realize you're leaving me
You built me up so high my heart can't stand to fall
And life without your love just isn't life at all

So walk out backwards if you must go
But please don't wave goodbye
Just wave one last hello
The truth won't hurt so much
If I can just pretend
So walk out backwards
And I'll think you're walking in

Well you walked into my heart in search of sympathy
And from that day down to this
You've walked all over me
And now you're walking out to love somebody new
But you're not by yourself
'Cause my heart's leaving too

So walk out backwards if you must go
But please don't wave goodbye
Just wave one last hello
The truth won't hurt so much
If I can just pretend
So walk out backwards
And I'll think you're walking in

I gave up cigarettes
I haven't had to light one yet
And it's been a year since I stopped
The same goes for alcohol
I don't touch the stuff at all
And I used to drink till I dropped
Those were tough this is easy
And it feels so good to say
Forgetting you is not that hard to do
I've done it a thousand times a day

Friends said it'd take some time
To get you off my mind
They thought I'd never let you go
Well I guess I proved them wrong
One more bad habit gone
Just like the whiskey and the smokes
Those were tough this is easy
Well I'm all right yeah I'm okay
Forgetting you is not that hard to do
I've done it a thousand times a day

I've given you up for good
Just like I said I would
The night you walked away
Forgetting you is not that hard to do
I've done it a thousand times a day
Yes I've done it a thousand times a day

Her eyes are blue just like the ocean
Her heart is a river free
Well now and then she gets the notion
And she finds her way to me


Her love’s like rain on a tin roof
Sweet song on a summer time storm
And the way that it moves you
It’s a melody of passion raging on
Then it’s gone

She tells me she will be back to see me
Every time she has to go
And I keep wondering just when that will be
Cuz with her you never


Her love’s like rain on a tin roof
Sweet song on a summer time storm
And the way that it moves you
It’s a melody of passion raging on
Then it’s gone

Like a thirsty field I can’t complain a bit
Cuz I’m thankful for every single drop I get


Her love’s like rain on a tin roof
Sweet song on a summer time storm
And the way that it moves you
It’s a melody of passion raging on
Then it’s gone

She’s gone she’s gone
My baby’s gone

You don't need reasons I understand
You can't go dreaming and not change a few plans
You gotta see the next page
Before your chance flies away

If you get to Arizona and 
You're walking through those lonely canyons
And you're standing in the middle of everything
Beauty like you've never imagined
As you go down the list of all the things
You thought would make you feel free
Call when you get to me

You'll love those warm winds 
Dancing through your hair
But take your jacket nights get cold out there
Drink it in like wine
Baby take your time

If you get to California
With the sun and the golden sand
And you're standing on the edge of the ocean
Wishing someone would hold your hand
As you cross off the list of all the things
You thought would make you feel free
Call when you get to me

When you get to where the grass feels greener
And the skies are forever blue
Listen to your heart sweet baby
You know it knows the truth

If you get to Arizona
Call when you get to me
If you get to California
Call when you get to me

Baby if you get that far
Call me baby

Everywhere I look the sun is shining
But it's always raining here inside
I can see
You really had a hold on me
It's a mean old love
With a flame that never dies

Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye

Everywhere I go you're in my shadow
When I turn around there's no one there
And it's a real bad sign
I'm walking on a real thin line
A fool in love with a fool that never cared

Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye
Won't you tell me why

Ask anyone you know
And they'll say love fades away
But this hearts' cryin' just like yesterday

And it's a real bad sign 
I'm walking on a real thin line
A fool in love with a fool that never cared

So won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye

Won't you tell me why
I can't say goodbye

I won't be bored
I won't be ignored
Hey

I won't be your dirty secret
I won't be your cure-all pill
And I won't run to fetch the water
Just to tumble down the hill

I won't be your Friday paycheck
I won't be the prize you flaunt
And I won't be your Martha Stewart baby
Or your all-night restaurant


But I will I will I will be your everything
If you make me feel like a woman should
I will I will I will be the whole shebang
You know I willbut

I won't be your crutch to lean on
I won't wear stiletto heels
I won't walk a mile in your shoes
Just so I know how it feels

I won't be your obligation
I won't be your Barbie doll
I won't be the portrait of perfection 
To adorn you wall




Hey - you know you know I will
All right

I won't be your lifetime girlfriend
I won't be just one of the guys
I won't be your mama's favorite
I refuse to be the last in line



Yeah I will I will I will be your everything
I will I will be the whole shebang
I will I will be your everything
I will I will I will I will - yeah

You know I will
You know you know I will
You know I will
You know you know I will - yeah

Just you and I
Sharing our love together
And I know in time
We'll build the dreams we treasure
We'll be all right just you and I

Just you and I
Just you and I
Sharing our love together
And I know in time
And I know in time
We'll build the dreams we treasure
And we'll be all right
Just you and I

And I remember our first embrace
That smile that was on your face
The promises that we made
And now your love is my reward
And I love you even more
Than I ever did before

Just you and I
Just you and I
We can entrust each other
With you in my life
With you in my life
They'll never be another
We'll be all right
Just you and I

And I remember our first embrace
That smile that was on your face
The promises that we made
And now your love is my reward
And I love you even more
Than I ever did before

We made it you and I

Where in the world did you come from 
Seems like I looked upI and there you were 
Didnt think about it then but when I look back I 
believe now 
That miracles do occur 



Cause I can reach up and touch any star in the sky 
Put my arms round the moon if I try 
Never thought I could feel so much love in my life 
No I never thought Id know howbut 
I do now 
Is this a dream or are you real 
I'm trying hard not to lose my cool 
But when you're kissing me 
I just get so lost in the moment 
I hope I'm not acting like some kind of fool 



Never had no one to miss me 
Never had no one who kissed me like you 
Never had no one who loved me like you 
I can reach up and touch any star in the sky 
Put my arms round the moon if I try 
Never thought I could feel so much love in my life 
No I never thought Id know howbut 
I do now

I laid a red rose
On your front porch
Wrote I love you 
On a note
I rang the door bell 
And turned to go
Baby when the curtains moved 
I couldn't believe the view



I saw the light in your window tonight
I saw two shadows holding each other tight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight

So take your cheatin' hands 
Off my red dress
'Cause I ain't wearin' 
This thing for you
I see you clearly now
And your lies too
They say that love is blind 
Baby not this time



Why baby why should I listen to you
I cried baby cried now I'm walking out the door

They say that love is blind baby not this time



Met an old man yesterday
Next to me on a westbound plane
He said I was married sixty years
I swear it feels like she's still here
Then he took out a picture

Staring at that black and white
The tears filled up in his eyes
I said You were a lucky man
He said I feel like I still am

When he told me her name
I heard myself say 

I wanna be Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's world
Somebody's day and night
One and only girl
A part of a love story
That never has an end
You know that's what every woman wants to be
Somebody's Chelsea

He made me laugh when he talked about
Their first date and her father's doubts
He said Even as her hair turned gray 
She still took my breath away
And that it never changed with time
That's when I closed my eyes

I wanna be Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's world
Somebody's day and night
One and only girl
A part of a love story
That never has an end
You know that's what every woman wants to be
Somebody's Chelsea

And when we finally said goodbye
I hugged him and said I'll never forget
How you showed me what it means

To be Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's world
Somebody's day and night
One and only girl
A part of a love story
That never has an end
You know that's what every woman wants to be
And I wanna be 
Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's Chelsea

He loves to make me cry
Loves to make me weep
Puts those tears in my eyes
Not the bitter but the sweet
Can't help but love that man of mine
'Cause he loves to make me cry

Just like the other day he came walking in
For no reason at all he had flowers in his hand
Turned on the stereo played our favorite song
Held me in his arms and we danced all night long
All night long

He loves to make me cry
Loves to make me weep
Puts those tears in my eyes
Not the bitter but the sweet
Can't help but love that man of mine
'Cause he loves to make me cry

Then we went upstairs and he took his time
Took me to a place some women never find
Showed me how it feels to mean everything to him
Yeah that's what he did and then he showed me again
Oh he showed me again

He loves to make me cry
Loves to make me weep
Puts those tears in my eyes
Not the bitter but the sweet
Can't help but love that man of mine
'Cause he loves to make me cry

Yes he loves to make me cry

Can't help but love that man of mine
'Cause he loves to make me cry
I said he loves to make me cry

I'm gonna wear you down
I'm gonna make you see
I'm gonna get to you
You're gonna give in to me

I'm gonna start a fire
You're gonna feel the heat
I'm gonna burn for you
You're gonna melt for me

Come on come on
Into my arms
Come on come on
Give in to me

You're gonna take my hand
Whisper the sweetest words
And if you're ever sad
I'll make you laugh
I'll chase the hurt

My heart is set on you
I don't want no one else
And if you don't want me
I guess I'll be all by myself

Come on come on
Into my arms
Come on come on come on
Give in to me

I'll use my eyes to draw you in
Until I'm under your skin
I'll use my lips I'll use my arms
Come on come on come on
Give in to me

Give in to me 

I was alone in the dark
Never let down my guard
Closed the curtain on my heart
So the world could not see
All the demons in me
Told myself I was free

Then you showed me how wrong I could be


Now I'm standing on a mountain of rubble
That once was a wall
Took years to build around me
And you came along
And you tore it down
Like it was nothing at all
Now it's a little scary
Learning to fall

When you looked in my eyes
Past the fear and false pride
You saw goodness inside
I can't believe how I feel
I believe love is real
And I'm ready to heal

You show me how right I can be



I was holding on now I'm letting go
I was holding on now I'm letting go
I was holding on now I'm letting go



I've got something to tell you that I just can't say
So I'm writing it down in case maybe someday
Our lives take a turn down a road
We can't see right now
I know you're happy and I'm happy for you
But since you found each other
I've been so confused
Cause I believe there's one soul on this earth
That was meant for mine
I was sent here to find

What if it's you
What if our hearts were meant to be one
What'll I do
Knowing that I'll never love anyone
As much as I do love you
What if it's true
What if it's you

If destiny called and I missed my cue
Do I get one more chance
Oh how I wish I knew
I'll never again put my heart in the hands of fate
If it's not too late

What if it's you
What if our hearts were meant to be one
What'll I do
Knowing that I'll never love anyone
As much as I do love you
What if it's true
What if it's you

If I ever hold you I'll never let go
But if I never do how will I know

What if it's you
What if our hearts were meant to be one
What'll I do
Knowing that I'll never love anyone
As much as I do love you
What if it's true
What if it's you

What'll I do
What if it's true
What if it's you

Now
All my life I’ve waited
And I’ve been afraid and
I wondered If I’d find
Someone to share my life

Every day I prayed and
Every night I searched in
Every stranger’s eyes
For some kind of sign

Me and my heart wishin’ in the dark
Tryin’ to believe in a sky full of stars
I was waiting for you 
A million empty days too much time and space
Every tear I cried every lonely night 
I was waiting for you

Now here you are
And my world is my world is so beautiful
Now here you are
And my life is and my life is so wonderful
Now

The past seems like a dream
Just vacancy
How did I exist before our first kiss
Oh I feel so lucky because I know you
Love me
And no one ever has like no one ever has

Me and my heart wishin’ in the dark
Tryin’ to believe in a sky full of stars
I was waiting for you
All those empty days all the time and space
Every tear I cried every lonely night
I was waiting for you

The past seems like a dream
Just vacancy
How did I exist before our first kiss
Oh I feel so lucky because I know you
Love me
And no one ever has like no one ever has

The past seems like a dream
Just vacancy
How did I exist before our first kiss
Oh I feel so lucky because I know you
Love me
And no one ever has like no one ever has

I'm rolling out of Bakersfield
My own private hell on wheels
But this time I'm gone for good
I've never gone this far before
Beyond the slammin' of the back screen door
But you never loved me like you should

And there ain't no telling what I'll find
But I might as well move down the line
'Cause there's no comfort here in your zip code
I'd rather break down on the highway
With no one to share my load
And cry on the shoulder of the road

It makes me feel a little low
Steel guitar on the radio
And it's kinda scary the way these truckers fly
So this is how leavin' feels
Drinking coffee and makin' deals with the One above
To get me through the night

'Cause there ain't no telling what I'll find
But I might as well move down the line
'Cause there's no comfort here in your zip code
I'd rather break down on the highway
With no one to share my load
And cry on the shoulder of the road

And there ain't no telling what I'll find
But I might as well move down the line
'Cause there's no comfort here in your zip code
I'd rather break down on the highway
With no one to share my load
And cry on the shoulder of the road
Cry on the shoulder of the road

Everybody's heart aches
Every time it opens
You don't know if you'll win or lose
You have to just let go

No I wasn't looking
It's funny how I found you
Just when I thought
I'd live my life alone

Maybe it's love
That I have longed for
Maybe it's love
I should be strong for
I'm tearing down the walls inside
I want to laugh and cry and kiss
Maybe it's love
I miss

I've close my heart down
So many seasons
I didn't want to hurt again
I didn't want to try

So I turned myself to ice and stone
Said I don't need anyone
And nobody else
Would ever make me cry

Maybe it's love
I've run away from
Maybe it's love
Bringing me back home
I'm tearing down the walls inside
I want to laugh and cry and kiss
Maybe it's love I miss

So put your arms around me now
Hold me tight
Show me how
No one has ever loved me more
I've waited for so long

Maybe it's love
Maybe I'm dreaming
Maybe it's love
I can believe in
I'm tearing down the walls inside
I want to laugh and cry and kiss
Maybe it's love
Maybe it's love
Maybe it's love
Like this

Red sun sittin' on the road behind her
A hundred miles out of her hometown
Drops a quarter in a beat up pay phone
Listens to it rattle on down
Voices cold as the phone she's holding
The connects way too clear
He's yellin' where's my dinner
She's too far gone to care She says listen here

There's a time to stand and the time is now or never
A time to fly a time to let go forever
A time to grow and a time to discover
Life is precious every second
You've wasted mine and it's my time

She puts a few more miles between them
He pours a distance of his own
Starts talking to the bottle
It's all that left now she's gone
He rages on till the National Anthem
Comes on his TV
Then he looks straight at the bottle
And says you did this to me
And then he screams

There's a time to stand and the time is now or never
A time to fly a time to let go forever
A time to grow and a time to discover
Life is precious every second
You've wasted mine and it's my time

It's my time it's my time it's my time
And the time is what you make it
It's my time it's my time it's my time
And time is what you're taking

There's a time to stand and the time is now or never
A time to fly a time to let go forever
A time to grow and a time to discover
Life is precious every second
You've wasted mine and it's my time

Every day here you come walkin'
I hold my tongue I don't do much talkin'
You say you're happy and you're doin' fine
Well go on baby I got plenty of time 'cause
Sad eyes never lie
Sad eyes never lie

For a while I've been watching you steady
Ain't gonna move 'till you're good and ready
You show up and then you shy away
But I know pretty soon you'll be
walkin' this way 'cause
Sad eyes never lie
Sad eyes never lie

Baby don't you know I don't care
Don't you know that I've been there
Well if somethin' in the air feels a little unkind
Don't worry darlin' it'll slip your mind

I know you think you'd never be mine
Well that's okay baby I don't mind
That shy smile's sweet that's a fact
Go ahead I don't mind the act

Here you come all dressed up for a date
Well one more step and it'll be too late
Blue blue ribbon in my hair
You're so sure I'll be standing there
I guess sad eyes never lie
Sad eyes never lie
I guess sad eyes never lie
Sad eyes never lie

As you walk away 
As we say goodbye; 
What I wouldn't give 
For a tender lie 


Say you'll never stop loving me 
Just as if it were true 
How much damage now honestly 
Could one tender lie do 

When we fall so far 
Are we wrong to try; 
To fight off the truth 
With a tender lie 

Say you're gonna come back to me 
And I'll believe that it's true 
How much damage now honestly 
Could one tender lie do 

When we loved before 
Do you still deny; 
Keeping out the truth 
With a tender lie 



wish someone would tell me when
i won't think of you again 
i'll get past the emptiness and
let a little happiness back in 
pretending not to care
leaves me half way there 
one of these one of these days
i'll be completely over you 
heaven knows how long it will take 
and one of these one of these days
i'll find somebody who'll love your memory away
one of these days
one of these days
some how some way 
ever since you've been gone 
time has a way of dragging on and on 
friends drop by to comfort me 
but i'm not much company for long 
oh i'll get past the what was 
if i live long enough
one of these one of these days
i'll be completely over you 
heaven knows how long it will take 
and one of these one of these days
i'll find somebody who'll love your memory away some way 
one of these days
one of these days
some how some way
one of these one of these days
i'll be completely over you 
heaven knows how long it will take 
and one of these one of these days
i'll find somebody who'll love your memory away some way 
one of these days
one of these days one of these days 
one of these days some how some way 
one of these days one of these days

A soft summer evening another time another place
He brought her red roses on their very first date
She got carried away by the things that he said
Time would erase them but she would never forget

And the roses heard it all
The rose in her hair the rose in her hand
The roses in the paper on the wall
There's a story to tell if the roses could talk

Somewhere close to midnight another time another place
She lays in the darkness with tears on her face
While he talks in his sleep confessing his love
He calls out a name that she's never heard of

And the roses heard it all
The rose in her hair the rose in her hand
The roses in the paper on the wall
There's a story to tell if the roses could talk

She never told him
She never let him see her cry
Only the roses know
What she kept down inside

The years took their toll and the angels took her away
Now there's family and friends at a cold winter's grave
He kneels down and whispers You're the only love that I've known
As he lays a rose on a cold marble atone
But the roses heard it all
The rose from her garden the rose in her Bible
The roses in the paper on the wall
There's a story to tell if roses could talk
What a story to tell if roses could talk

With lipstick on his collar and a trace of cheap perfume
He undresses in the darkness and eases into bed
With her face turned to the other wall she pretends to be asleep
But it doesn't really matter 'cause there's nothin' to be said

He calls from work to tell her he's sorry about last night
If he uses all the right words she'll forgive him once again
But the phone just keeps on ringin' and he knows that something's wrong
He feels his heart start pounding and his head begins to spin

Phones are ringin' all over town
North and south and east and west on main street up and down
He's got friends of his callin' friends of hers
But she's nowhere to be found
Phones are ringin' all over town

He calls the hospital her sister's house and the place that does her hair
God if somethin' ever happened he'd surely lose his mind
And he's thinkin' it's just like she's disappeared into thin air
As American flight #204 departed right on time

Phones are ringin' all over town
North and south and east and west on main street up and down
He's got friends of his callin' friends of hers
But she's nowhere to be found
Phones are ringin' all over town

Well he knows she'd never leave him
She's just got to be around
Phones are ringin'
Phones are ringin'
Phones are ringin' all over town

He said I grew up in Wichita
In a Mayberry kind of town
He never liked overalls
Or haulin' hay 'til sundown
He said he dreamed about LA
As he plowed away the day on an old John Deere
I said Boy let me warn you
In southern California there's some fast trains here

You're not in Kansas anymore
Can't be too careful that's for sure
City lights will led you on
Morning comes and they'll be gone
So write my number on your wall
You can call me anytime at all
I'm so happy now boy
You're not in Kansas anymore

He said do you know where Carson lives
So we drove up to Malibu
Cruisin' down Sunset Strip
I let him steal a kiss or two
Under the Hollywood sign
I tried to hide a smile as I whispered low
I wanna be the first to tell you
Here we say Rodel not rodeo

You're not in Kansas anymore
Can't be too careful that's for sure
City lights will led you on
Morning comes and they'll be gone
So write my number on your wall
And call me anytime at all
I'm so happy now boy
You're not in Kansas anymore

I'm so happy now boy
You're not in Kansas anymore

Yesterday I thought that I walked alone
And that love was just a memory
But a nightingale followed me back home
And my love was waiting there for me

I had lost my faith as lovers often do
When the storm clouds gather overhead
But the nightingale sang a note so true
That I knew I'd lost my fear instead

And to think that I said love was for fools
And that time would never heal these old wounds
But the nightingale saved a prayer for me
In the twilight he played a faithful tune

I have heard the lark over in the vale
And I've heard the lonesome whippoorwill
But the sweetest song is the nightingale's
And I know I'll never get my fill


Give me a sad song that I can hold on to
Anything to set me free
Just one big cry big tears in my eyes
To wash you away from me
I need a night all by myself
Got some things I need to work out
I got this fever that just won't break
I got some troubles I got to shake
Give me give me





I know I know I'm gonna have to cleanse my soul
If I'm ever gonna get back on my way
One night one night one dark and lonely night
And then will come a brighter day
Just give me one night one night one dark and lonely night
And then will come a brighter day



I am timeless I am patient
I'm beside you and above
I'm the words when you need comfort
I'm the feeling you call love

You say that you can take or leave me
You think right now that you don't need me
Some way somehow young heart believe me
One day you will
One day you will

You're a vessel your a temple
You're a journey just begun
You're a young one who is running
You are destined to find love

And when you're lost that's when you'll find me
We can't see till we are blinded
It's already all been decided
That one day you will
One day you will

You say that you can take or leave me
You think right now that you don't need me
Some way somehow young heart believe me
One day you will
One day you will
One day you will

I am timeless I am patient
I'm the feeling you call love

We came out west together with a common desire
The fever we had might-a set the west coast on fire
Two months later got a troublin' mind
'Cause my baby moved out and left me behind
And it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine

Well the way he left sure turned my head around
Seemed like over night he just up and put me down
Ain't gonna let it bother me today
'Cause I've been workin' and I'm too tired anyway
And it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine

Well I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
I've been doin' all I can but opportunity sure comes slow
Thought I'd be a big star by today
But I've been sleepin' in a warehouse in West LA
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine

Well I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
I've been doin' all I can but opportunity sure comes slow
I thought I'd be a big star by today
But I've been sleepin' in a warehouse in West LA
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine
Yes it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine 
Well it's all right 'cause it's midnight and I got two more bottles of wine

I don't want to see you
'Cause I don't want to feel you

Don't look so surprised
I told you that I'd say good-bye
If you couldn't just make up your mind
You keep saying love can wait
But I can't and it's too late
This old heart has just run out of time

I don't want to see you
'Cause I don't want to feel you
I don't want a love that I can't win baby
I don't want you to call
'Cause if I can't have it all
I don't want to see you again

When your new life gets you down
Don't be tempted to come around
Just think of all the times I let you slide
And when your teardrops finally come
You'll realize that I'm the one
But I won't be there when it's your turn to cry

I don't want to see you
'Cause I don't want to feel you
I don't want a love that I can't win baby
I don't want you to call
'Cause if I can't have it all
I don't want to see you

I don't want to see you
I don't want to feel you
I don't want a love that I can't win baby
I don't want you to call
'Cause if I can't have it all
I don't want to see you again

They drank their anniversary glass
A silent moment passed
Then they kissed
She knows there's something on his mind
He'll tell her in due time
What it is

He says I've never built
Your mansion on a hill
Or warmed you in the Spanish sun
I simply blink my eye
And think as years fly by
Of all the things we've never done

She smiles and takes his hand in hers
And says It just occured
To me now
The thought that brings you such regret
What hasn't happened yet
It makes me proud

You never walked away
When I needed you to stay
Or made me feel I'm not the one
There've been no broken vows
And there reason we're here now
Is all the things we've never done

We've never grown apart
You never broke my heart
With secrets that you've kept me from
We've never been untrue
And I'm still here with you
Through all the things we've never done

Joey was a fighter 
And he fought to dream 
He said someday he would have a fancy car 
And hed leave Tennessee 
I was just a shy wallflower 
Just a wideeyed teenage girl 
But maybe intrigue or just insanity 
Made me want to enter Joeys world 
His touch made me feel beautiful 
So much passion I lost my head 


He was like James Dean in Tennessee 
He was a movie star 
A young girls dream 
From what I hear he could never leave 
But to me hell always be 
James Dean in Tennessee 
He tired to smoke them cigarettes 
And he always made me laugh 
He said Id be his pickup truck queen 
And someday Id be his better half 
I left there a year ago 
And I heard the rebel went bad 
That he had just served time for a minor crI'me 
And he was livin with his old man 


I wonder what ol Joey thinks 
When he hears me singing on the radio 
Will he ever know I loved hI'm so 
Sometimes were meant to stay 
Sometimes were meant to go 


Wasted days and wasted nights
I have left for you behind
for you don't belong to me
you belong to someone else

Why should I keep loving you
when I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name
when you're to blame
for making me blue


Don't you remember the days
that you went away and left me
I was so lonely
I prayed for only you my love

Why should I keep loving you
when I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name
when you're to blame
for making me blue


Don't you remember the days
that you went away and left me
I was so lonely
I prayed for only you my love

Why should I keep loving you
when I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name
when you're to blame
for making me blue

You have worn a path
Right up to my heart
You come in for a while but you don't stay
And I've come to realize
That your promises are lies
To buy you time when you want to get away

You must think my heart has swingin' doors
The way that you keep comin' back and forth
I can feel it's getting close to closing time
And I won't be leavin' my heart open anymore

Well I've heard you're back in town
I suppose you'll come around
When nights are cold and friends are hard to find
You always seem to wait
'Til all the pieces are in place
Then you walk back in and rearrange my life

You must think my heart has swingin' doors
The way that you keep comin' back and forth
And I can feel it's getting close to closing time
And I won't be leavin' my heart open anymore
So if you're walkin' down my street just keep on walkin' by
I'm hangin' out a sign sayin' this well has run dry 

You must think my heart has swingin' doors
You must think my heart has swingin' doors
The way that you keep comin' back and forth
I can feel it's getting close to closin' time
And I won't be leavin' my heart open anymore
I won't be leavin' my heart open anymore
I won't be leavin' my heart open anymore

I've been through hell and half of Louisiana
Lookin' for a man like you
I know you could have any woman you want
And I know you've had a few
I know I've got some stiff competition
They ain't got nothin' on me
'Cause I've got something that you've been missin'
I practice what I preach

'Cause I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your friend
And I wanna be your full-time woman
Closer than your kin
I wanna be your satisfaction
Be your number one
And just when you think I can't love you any better
Well I have just begun
'Cause there's more where that came from
There's more where that came from

And I want your clothes in my closet
My name on your mail
And I want my love to be your faucet
Drinkin' from an endless well
I want your kids to call me Mama
I want you to call me Hon
I wanna be the one you love and honor
When it's all been said and done

'Cause I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your friend
And I wanna be your full-time woman
Closer than your kin
I wanna be your satisfaction
Be your number one
And just when you think I can't love you any better
Well I have just begun
'Cause there's more where that came from
That's right there's more where that came from

I might bite my lip look down at my shoes
I might clench my fist or just leave the room
But I'm not gonna cry not one single drop
Cause once I get started out I may never stop
I might even laugh right in your face
When you come out and ask oh if I'll be okay
But I'm not gonna cry not one single drop
Cause once I get started out I may never stop
It's gonna take the night of fighting with all I've got to keep the first tear from falling down
but if I don't hold the waters back the dam is gonna crack and I'll be damned if I'm gonna drown
So I'm not gonna cry if that's what you thought
Cause once I get started out I may never stop
No I'm not gonna cry not one single drop
Cause once I get started I may never stop
So I might bite my lip look down at my shoes

I don't wanna think
That you could be runnin' around
After all the love
That I have shown you

I won't knock on your door
I won't call to see if you're home
But I won't close my eyes

Love's a matter of trust
And I just want to believe in us
But last night in your kiss
I felt a lie on your lips

I won't knock on your door
I won't call to see if you're home
But I won't close my eyes

There are two kinds of love
Those who are true and those untrue
I see black and white
Are you somewhere lost between the two

I won't knock on your door
I won't call to see if you're home
I won't knock on your door
I won't call to see if you're home
But I won't close my eyes
No I won't close my eyes

I don't wanna think
That you could be runnin' around

Mhmmm Mhmmm Owwww Yeahhhhhh 

Well I can summon up my courage
Take on the whole world
Turn around and break down just like a little girl
And I come out swingin' when my back's against the wall 

And my Mama always told me better walk before you crawl
I need a man who can love all the women I am 

I'm a mother of lost causes
A sister of the road
I give my heart to a song but I never sell my soul
I'm good at keeping it together when the edges start to fray 

When I'm sewing up the loose ends of everyday
I need a man who can love all the women I am

Sometimes I'm hard to handle
Burn hotter than a candle but I melt in the right hands
Boy you love without condition
It ain't always easy livin' with all the women I am

I'm a daughter of the red dirt Okie dust still in my bones
But I can light up New York City with my red hair and rhinestones
I'll still be my Mama's baby when my babies fly away
My moods change like the weather but my faith it stays the same

I need a man who can stand all the women I am
I need a man who can love all the women I am

Sometimes I'm hard to handle
Burn hotter than a candle but I melt in the right hands
Boy you love without condition
It ain't always easy livin' with all the women I am

Hey I'm a realist
I'm a dreamer
I'm a silver linin' seeker
I'm a devil or an angel who come running when you need her

Cause I need a man who can love all the women I am
Ohh I want a man who can love all the women I am
Hey you're a man who can love all the women I am
You're the man I needed all along
You can handle me baby
All the women I am
Yeah you're the man
All the women I am

Like a wild wood flower
Doesn't have to reach for the sun
And when it needs a drop of water
It doesn't have to ask the rain to come

I don't wanna work for your love
I don't wanna try to be
Something that you're looking for
You're never gonna find in me

So let the wind chase you I can't do it anymore
Let the road run after you like I always did before
Let the stars catch your eye
'Cause I've tried and tried and tried
And I want to so let the wind chase you

No one says the diamond ain't precious
Just because it hasn't yet been found
And no one blames the moon for not shining
Just because it's hidden by the clouds

I don't wanna blame myself
Thinkin' that I'm not enough
Wonder what's wrong with me
Because I couldn't win your love

So let the wind chase you I can't do it anymore
Let the road run after you like I always did before
Let the stars catch your eye
'Cause I've tried and tried and tried
And I want to so let the wind chase you

I don't wanna work for your love
I don't wanna try to be
Something that you're looking for
You're never gonna find in me

So let the wind chase you I can't do it anymore
Let the road run after you like I always did before
Let the stars catch your eye
'Cause I've tried and tried and tried
And I want to so let the wind chase you

Let the wind chase you

She can hear his car as it pulls in the drive
She can whisper a prayer: Thank God he's alive
She can meet him at the door; catch him when he falls
She can even believe that it isn't his fault
But she can't save him

She can make his coffee in the cold light of day
She can make his excuses: tell the boss he'll be late
She can wave at the neighbours then kiss him goodbye
And not say a word 'bout what happened last night
But she can't save him

Sometimes she dreams that he's caught in a stream
And the water keeps pulling him down
She reaches for him as he pulls her in
She wakes just before she drowns

She can remember the man that he was
And still shed a tear for what he's become
She can live in that house until the day
She sees that it's only herself she can save
But she can't save him

And that day she'll know she hasn't failed
'Cause nothing can change until he saves himself

No she can't save him
No she can't save him
No she can't save him

A long time forgotten the dreams that just fell by the way
The good life he promised ain't what she's livin' today
But she never complains of the bad time or the bad things he's done
She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come

Yeah she's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his wicked ways she don't understand
With teardrops and laughter they pass through this world hand in hand
She's a good hearted woman lovin' a good timin' man

He likes the bright lights and night life and good time friends
When the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him but she does the best that she can
She's a good hearted woman lovin' a good timin' man

I'm a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
And I love him in spite of his wicked ways I never understand
With teardrops and laughter we pass through this world hand in hand
I'm a good hearted woman lovin' a good timin' man

With teardrops and laughter we pass through this world hand in hand
I'm a good hearted woman lovin' a good timin' man
I'm just a good hearted woman lovin' a good timin' man

It's a way of mine to say just what I'm thinking
And to do the things I really want to do
And you want to change the part of me I'm proud of
So I can't be myself when I'm with you

Oh you never liked the clothes I wear on Sunday
Just because I don't believe the way you do
But I believe the Lord knows I'm unhappy
And I can't be myself when I'm with you

I can't be myself and be what pleases you
Deep down inside I don't believe that you want me to
And it's not my way to take so long deciding
That I can't be myself when I'm with you

I can't be myself and be what pleases you
Deep down inside I don't believe that you want me to
And I believe the Lord knows I'm unhappy
And I can't be myself when I'm with you
And I can't be myself when I'm with you

There ain't no excuse that's what my mama said
You gotta get up and get outta bed
Roll up your sleeves put your back into it
If your gonna get it done then you better get to it
No matter what it is you want to do
You got to have a little want to
Inside of you
That goes a long long way
A little nothing I can't doAttitude
No matter what folks say
Well big dreams do come true
All you gotta go 
Is have a little want to
I remember sittin' on the livin' room floor
My brother tried to show me how to make a G chord
My hands were small my fingers hurt
That's when he said it'll take a lot of work
But if I can do it girl so can you
You got to have a little want to
Inside of you
That goes a long long way
A little nothing I can't doAttitude
No matter what folks say
Well big dreams do come true
All you gotta go 
Is have a little want to
Oh now I make my living out here singing on this stage
When people ask me how I got here I just look at them and say
You got to have a little want to
Inside of you
That goes a long long way
A little nothing I can't doAttitude
No matter what folks say
You got to have a little want to
A little nothing I can't doAttitude
No matter what folks say
Cause big dreams do come true
All you gotta do
Is have a little want to
That's all you gotta do
Is have a little want to
Keep that attitude
And have a little want towant towant to

I took a plane around the world
Trying to loose her memory
but every where that I touched down
I found it waiting there for me

You cant run from love there's just no place
In this world you can hide
You cant run from love
When it's looking for you all you can do is
give up

Sail across the seven sea's
Climb apon the mountian high
Build a wall around your heart
It's going to find you every single time

you can travel in a time machine
Disapear without a trace
It won't matter where you go
It's going to find you any place

You can travel in a time machine
Disapear without a trace
it won't matter where you go
It's going to find you any place

You can't run from love there's just no place
In this world you can hide
You can't run from love ooooo
you can't run from love there's just no place
In this world cause I've tried

You can't run from love ooooooo
You can't run from love 

Once upon a time
Somewhere in your past
Someone said forever
But that promise didn't last

Now you don't believe
Love is ever true
Steel yourself against the day
When I stopped loving you

When the day comes that I don't love you
Every star will fall out of the sky
And every mountain will tumble down
And every river run dry

For every drop of rain
That ever touched the ground
For every tear that ever fell
And never made a sound

I'll be there
To hear you call
And I'll be there to catch you baby
Should you ever fall





And every river run dry

I rushed home from work like I always do
I spent my whole day just thinking of you
When I walked through the front door my whole life was changed
Cause nobody answered when I called your name

Oh the lonely sound of my voice calling
Is driving me insane
And just like rain the tears keep falling
Nobody answers when I call your name

A note on the table that told me goodbye
It said you'd grown weary of living a lie
Your love has ended but mine still remains
But nobody answers when I call your name

Oh the lonely sound of my voice calling
Is driving me insane
And just like rain the tears keep falling
Nobody answers when I call your name

Oh the lonely sound of my voice calling
Is driving me insane is driving me crazy
And just like rain the tears keep falling
Nobody answers when I call when I call your name

The sky's been gray every day since I lost you
But I know the sun is shinin' somewherebeyond the blue
My eyes were red when you said that we were through
But now I can see better days for mejust beyond the blue

Beyond the blueon the other side of lonely
And it's only a matter of timeuntil I'm
Lookin' back and feelin' like I'm over you
And these tears are gone and I'm beyond the blue

Beyond the blueon the other side of lonely
And it's only a matter of timeuntil I'm
On my feet and I meet somebody new
And I fall in love again beyond the blue
When these tears are gone and I'm beyond the blue

Well I was born full speed ahead
I was racin' time my mama said
I really covered some ground 'til you slowed me down
And took my life where angels fear to tread

Everywhere I go your hands are on the wheel
When everybody thinks they're mine
It takes a real man to take a backseat to a woman
But honey you've been drivin' all the time

Your love's so unconditional
You never push and you never pull
And your love is so blind
You walk a step behind
You start me every day and let me roll

Everywhere I go your hands are on the wheel
When everybody thinks they're mine
It takes a real man to take a backseat to a woman
But honey you've been drivin' all the time

And with each new day that passes by
And every dream I dare to try
You lift me gently up
So tenderly with love
And give me ever stronger wings to fly

Everywhere I go your hands are on the wheel
When everybody thinks they're mine
It takes a real man to take a backseat to a woman
But honey you've been drivin' all the time
Honey you've been drivin' all the time

Beyond the reef where the sea is dark and cold
My love has gone and my dreams grow old
There'll be no tears there'll be no regretting
Will she remember me will she forget 

I'll send a thousand flowers where the trade winds blow
I'll send my lonely heart cause I love her so 

Someday I know she'll come back again to me
Til then my heart will be beyond the reef 

I'll send a thousand flowers where the trade winds blow
I'll send my lonely heart cause I love her so 

I'll send a thousand flowers where the trade winds blow
I'll send my lonely heart cause I love her so

Tell me when I can open my eyes
I don't want to watch you walk out that door
There's no easy way to get through goodbye
I'd probably try and talk you into staying once more

Or I'd lie and say it's all for the best
Wish you luck and say I have no regrets
But I'm not up to being strong
So I'll wait until you're gone
Is it over yet is it over yet

A taxi's waiting in the driveway for you
You call my name I guess your ready to leave
I'd like to help you with a suitcase or two
But I'm afraid I'm gonna wind up down on my knees

I should tell you that I want you to go
I really need to spend some time on my own
Smile and say goodbye
So you don't see me dying inside
Is it over yet is it over yet

I should lie and say it's all for the best
Wish you luck and say I have no regrets
But I'm not up to being strong
So I'll wait until your gone
Is it over yet is it over yet

We are all a little crazy we are all a little weak
And we all are very fragile when there's nothing left to speak
When there's no one left to talk to no more tears are left to cry
Will you stand up for the right thing or continue in denial
I don't know

Well you know I'd love to help you you know I'd love to heal
But without the hands of God you will never be revealed
So take off your mask of happiness take off your mask of fame
We all know that you've got problems just like everybody's name

I don't know why you fold in the arms of reality
Why do you break with every wave in your stormy sea
You know I'd love to think you were doing fine but I'd be lying

So don't tell me everything is good don't walk on bitter ground
I have seen you at your worst and I still love you when you're down
But I hate to see you live like this I hate to see you crying
And I hate to see you tangled in her web of sex and lies
Do you have a god you pray to do you have a god you love
Do you have some twisted fear about the will from up above
Do you wait for him in silence do you wait for him in vain
Do you think some crazy fool is gonna preach your pain

I don't know why you fold in the arms of reality
Why do you break with every wave in your stormy sea
Why do you cringe at the wake of every godly dream
While I watch you laughing on the brink of insecurity
You know I'd love to say you were doing fine but I'd be lying

So why must you walk with burdens much too big for you to bear
When you know it's not your fault
There are saints and sinners everywhere
You don't have to smile I can read between your lines
I read guilt and I read mercy I read glory to the father
I read bitterness and suffering and love for all your children
I read brokenness inside your heart and scars too deep to see
I read pain from a young boy who's father left too early
Who's mother tried to mold him into what she'd love to be:

I don't know why you fold in the arms of reality
Why do you break with every wave in your stormy sea
And why do you cringe at the wake of every godly dream while
I watch you laughin' on the brink of insecurity
You know we'd love to help yeah you know we'd love to heal
But without the hands of God you will never be revealed
You know we'd all love to say you were doing fine but we'd be lying

Will it be my Uncle Ronnie I barely knew him when he left
He was only nineteen when he crashed that red Corvette
Will it be my great grandmother with some cookies that she baked
Oh I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate

Will it be my goodfriend Matthew who spent his life in a chair
Will he coming running to me the day I get up there
Or that bully back in high school I told my Mama that I hate
Oh I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate

Will it be a choir of Angels with some heavenly refrain
Or Saint Peter like I've always heard with his big book of names
Will it be my old dog Bailey who died when I was eight
Oh I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate



I pray it's not my wife my daughter or my son
Cause that would mean the good Lord took em before my time was done
Tonight they're all sound asleep as I lie here wide awake
And I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate

We're brought into this world with God only knows how many years
We crawl we walk we run we dance
We cry a million tears
And in a flash our lives are over
And we're face to face with fate
Oh I wonder who's gonna greet me at the gate
Who's gonna greet me at the gate

Should've known you'd come around
Did your conscience bother you
Well I guess I forgive you now but that's all that I can do
Ain't nothing lonely as the truth


You should've lied to me baby
You should've tried just a little bit harder now baby
You see my pride has been talking to me lately
And you can't come back you can never come back
I won't stand another woman
You should've lied
You overestimated me
Thinking I would understand
Believing that your honesty
Would make me see a bigger man
Was that all part of your plan 



You should've lied
You should've lied to my baby
You should have lied 



Please don't bring me flowers
Tied up in a pretty bow
I'd trade a thousand roses
For just one hand to hold

And I don't want no candy
Sugar hurts my teeth
All I want is you tonight
That'd be really sweet

There's nothin' at the five-and-dime that I really need
Your kiss is the only gift that means a thing to me
Bring me all your lovin'
That's somethin' you ain't tried
Bring me all your lovin'
And I'll be satisfied

I don't want a poem
Written fancy on a card
I'd rather have I love you
Scribbled on my heart

And I won't wear a new dress
From a downtown store
Wrap me up in your arms
And baby I'll be yours

There's nothin' at the five-and-dime that I really need
Your kiss is the only gift that means a thing to me
Bring me all your lovin'
That's somethin' you ain't tried
Bring me all your lovin'
And I'll be satisfied

Yeah bring me all your lovin'
Somethin' you ain't tried
Bring me all your lovin'
And I'll give you all of mine

There's nothin' at the five-and-dime that I really need
Your kiss is the only gift that means a thing to me
Yeah bring me all your lovin'
Throw your presents in the creek
Bring me all your lovin'
And I'll be tickled pink

You're asking me to open up
I'm tryin' my best to give enough
To keep this love alive
It wouldn't be so hard for me to do
If it hadn't have been for all my heart's been through

But once you've learned to be lonely
And lonely is the only thing you've known
It begins to feel like home
It becomes your comfort zone
Once you've learned to be without someone
And settle for the silence of an empty room
Oh it changes you
There's a lot you have to undo
Once you've learned to be lonely

It becomes a habit of the heart
To be afraid and even start
To try and love again
I want to give you myself to you
But I've been alone that I'm scared to move

But once you've learned to be lonely
And lonely is the only thing you've known
It begins to feel like home
It becomes your comfort zone
Once you've learned to be without someone
And settle for the silence of an empty room
Oh it changes you
There's a lot you have to undo
Once you've learned to be lonely

I've built walls but I feel them falling down
Touch by touch your love is my way out

But once you've learned to be lonely
And lonely is the only thing you've known
It begins to feel like home
It becomes your comfort zone
Once you've learned to be without someone
And settle for the silence of an empty room
Oh it changes you
There's a lot you have to undo
Once you've learned to be lonely

There's a lot you have to undo
Once you've learned to be lonely

You fight for every breath
Caught without a ship in this sea of neglect
The one you swore to love is pulling you down
You're in over your head
Chilled to the bone by the waters you've tread
Chart a course to land before you drown

Swim to the nearest distant shore
There's only so much a heart can endure
You gave it your best forgive yourself
You can't hold on anymore
It's not as far as it might seem
Now it's time to let go of old dreams
Every heart for itself
Swim to the nearest distant shore

He said for you he'd change
Then he'd let you down and watch you take the blame
You're trapped between his lies and the great unknown
You vowed you would not fail
But this ain't success it's a living hell
There's nothing left to lose you're already alone

Swim to the nearest distant shore
There's only so much a heart can endure
You gave it your best forgive yourself
You can't hold on anymore
It's not as far as it might seem
Now it's time to let go of old dreams
Every heart for itself
Swim to the nearest distant shore

It's good to see you come 'round it's been a while
Sure is nice to see your smile
Yah I'm doing better now thought about
Callin' you a hundred times

Oh I had left a couple messages
And I never heard a word
Not one


Where were you when I needed somebody
Where were you when the walls started caving in
I was waiting for someone to save me
When I was coming unglued
Where were you

A lot of things got pretty bad pretty fast
I never thought you'd turn your back
You left me out there all alone hanging on
I just have to deal with that

Oh I can count on you when everything is easy
But when the going gets tough
I guess not



I had to find my own way
Now that I've made it through



Set me free why don't you baby
Get out of my life why don't you baby
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on

Why do you keep a comin' around
Playin' with my heart
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a new start
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me

Set me free why don't you baby
Get out of my life why don't you baby
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on

You say although we broke up
You still wanna be just friends
But how can we be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart again

You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul need to be free
Now that you got your freedom baby
You wanna still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else

Why don't you be a man about it
And set me free
You don't care a thing about me
You're just using me
So get out get out get out of my life
And let me sleep at night
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on

Keep me hangin' on

Keep me hangin' on

When you hit rock bottom
You've got two ways to go
Straight up
And sideways
I have seen my share of hard times
And I'm letting you know
Straight up 
Is my way

Things are tough all over
But I've got good news
When you get down to nothing 
You've got nothing to lose
I was born naked
But I'm glory bound
And a dead end street 
Is just a place to turn around



When the sky is the limit 
Up on easy street
Rock bottom 
Ain't no place to be
Rock bottom 
Ain't no place for me

When the law of the jungle 
Is the law of the land
Good luck
Stayin' alive
I keep a clinched fist under
This hat in my hand
'Cause only the strong survive

Things are tough all over
But I've got good news
When you get down to nothin'
You've got nothin' to lose
Anyway rock bottom 
Is good solid ground
And a dead end street 
Is just a place to turn around

When the sky is the limit
Up on easy street
Rock bottom 
Ain't no place to be
Rock bottom 
Ain't no place for me

You don't have to move that mountain
Just help me Lord to climb it
You don't have to move that stumblin' block
Just show me the way around it

We must climb a great high mountain
To reach God's gracious kingdom
In His words you'll find the strength
If you will just believe them

You don't have to move that mountain
Just help me Lord to climb it
You don't have to move that stumblin' block
Just show me the way around it

Well the way is filled with pitfalls
And sometimes we may falter
You can have His grace my friend
On your knees down at the altar

You don't have to move that mountain
Just help me Lord to climb it
You don't have to move that stumblin' block
Just show me the way around it

I took him for granted
Now looking back at it
He's not the only one to blame
Between the jobs and the kids
Wasn't much time for him
We let the fire slip away from the flame

Guess I shouldn't be surprised
But as hard as I try
I can't believe it's happened to me
But I know where he's at
And I know it's a fact
I'd have to be blind not to see

He's out buying her roses
And where that leaves me God only knows
I know I should tell him
To leave me forever
But what'll I do if he goes

Should I put up a fight
Does it matter who's right
Should I ruin my life or my pride
Can we save what we had
And if he comes back
Will I ever get it out of my mind

He's out buying her roses
And where that leaves me God only knows
I know I should tell him
To leave me forever
But what'll I do if he goes

He's out buying her roses
And where that leaves me God only knows
I know I should tell him
To leave me forever
But what'll I do if he goes

What'll I do if he goes
What'll I do if he goes

Well I drove past your house last night
And I looked in your window
Lately I ain't been feelin' right
And I don't know the cure no
Still I can't keep from wonderin'
If I still figure in your life

Could you take me back and try me again
Could you try me again

I drove around in this lonesome town
Felt just like a beginner
Friends I saw they just brought me down
They're so cynical and bitter
Well I guess I'm just like them now
I never thought I'd turn out like that

Could you take me back and try me again
Could you try me again

Well you say that I cheated
I was not what you needed
Well you're not being kind
When you say you tried
And you know you lied
My hands are tied
Oh try me again

I'm gonna knock on your door 
'Til you say you'll come back again
And love me some more
Oh try me again
Could you try me again
Oh try me again

I hear a lonesome dove off in the distance
His cry echoes out through the hills
He's sad that his lover flew off with another
And I know the sorrow he feels

Lonesome dove we're not that different
You sing a sad song but you're not alone
You've been forever forsaken by the one that you love
I know how you feel lonesome dove

I've tried to run from the pain of his memory
But I can't find a place I can hide
And that old lonesome dove is gonna mourn for his love
No matter how far he flies

Lonesome dove we're not that different
You sing a sad song but you're not alone
You've been forever forsaken by the one that you love
I know how you feel lonesome dove

Well everybody knows you been steppin' on my toes
And I'm gettin' pretty tired of it
You keep a steppin' out of line and a messing with my mind
If you had any sense you'd quit

Cause ever since I was a little teeny weeny girl
I said you were the only man in my whole world
Now you'd better do some thinkin' then you'll find
You got the only mama that'll walk the line

I keep a-workin' every day all you wanna do is play
I'm gettin' tired of staying home all night
Well I'm a-coming unglued from your funny little moods
Now honey baby that ain't right

Cause ever since I was a little teeny weeny girl
I said you were the only man in my whole world
And now you'd better do some thinkin' then you'll find
You got the only mama that'll walk the line

You keep a-packin' on my clothes
Nearly everybody knows that you're still just a-puttin' me on
And when I start a-walkin' gonna hear you start a-squawkin'
And a-beggin' me to come back home

Cause ever since I was a little teeny weeny girl
I said you were the only man in my whole world
Now you'd better do some thinkin' then you'll find
You got the only mama that'll walk the line
You got the only mama that'll walk the line

After you came in late last night
You said you'd been alone
Just needed some room to clear your mind
A little time away from home

Told me you were down on Highway 9
Down by the river bend
But this town has ears and this town has eyes
And a whole lot of so called friends
Oooh that ain't the way I heard it
Oooh that ain't the way I heard it

Don't you think I wanna trust every word you say
Don't you think I wanna look in your eyes
And feel suspicion slip away
When you say you got nothin' to hide
Oooh that ain't the way I heard it
Oooh that ain't the way I heard it

Throw me out a lifeline baby
Offer me a grain of truth
Treat me with a little bit of dignity
I think I deserve that much from you

Gimme one reason for stayin' cool
Tell me they're no good liars
Don't make me play your pathetic fool
Baby show me that old desire

After you came in late last night
You said you'd been alone
Just needed some room to clear your mind
A little time away from home

Told me you were down on Highway 9
Down by the river bend
But this town has ears and this town has eyes
And a whole lot of so called friends
Oooh that ain't the way I heard it
Oooh that ain't the way I heard it

I watch the sun going down
While I stand on sacred ground
Where once the night found us
In the twilight of our love

You said you'd meet me here
And I'm all alone
You sounded so sincere
Did you lead me on

I told the starry sky to wait for you
I told the wind to sigh like lovers do
I even told the night you were true
And you would be here soon
And now I'm lying to the moon

And so the night takes me in
Like a sympathetic friend
And sends the wind through the trees
So the willow weeps for me

The shadows fool my eyes
And I think I see you
Then they start to cry
Don't you know they believed you

I told the starry sky to wait for you
I told the wind to sigh like lovers do
I even told the night you were true
And you would be here soon
And now I'm lying to the moon

I told the starry sky to wait for you
I told the wind to sigh like lovers do
I even told the night you were true
And you would be here soon
And now I'm lying to the moon

I could lose my vision
My eyes no longer see
I could lose my religion
In my struggle to believe

That would be a loss
That would be a cross
I'd somehow rise above
But Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love

I've traded my innocence
For the secrets of the night
Felt my calloused conscience
Lose its grip on wrong and right

It cut me to the bone
But somehow I've held on
'Cause I could feel your touch
But Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love

'Cause you are the one light that shines on me
Without your love God knows where I'd be

Lost without a prayer
Somewhere way out there
My soul would turn to dust
Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love

'Cause you are the one light that shines on me
Without your love God knows where I'd be

So hold me close again
Tell me it won't end
And that will be enough
Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love

Heaven help me
If I ever lose your love

What good's a dollar 
Without your baby sister
Two scoops of ice cream 
On a summer afternoon
We ran wild 
And all we ever wanted
Was to rule the world
Between our house and school



We move on
Put those dreams away
Thinking that we'll find them
Come some rainy day

First time I saw you 
I knew I would love you
Half way through sophomore year 
I finally asked your name
When I kissed you 
I lost my heart completely
All we wanted
Was just to stay that way

We move on
Put those dreams away
Hoping that we'll find them
Come some rainy day
How could I know
That everything would change
Except the way I miss you
Come some rainy day



I'll sit and laugh with friends
At what we've all been through
But I still catch my breath
When someone mentions you



She was good at late night listening
When he'd call her on the phone
She was good to come and get him
When he couldn't make it home
She was good to make love to
And they did now and then
She was good to never ask
When he'd be back again

She wasn't good enough for him
For his family or his friends
He kept her out there on a limb
Wouldn't let her go wouldn't let her in
She wasn't good enough for him

She was there on his bad days
And for years he led her on
We all knew she had a bad case
He was doing her all wrong
She couldn't bring herself to do the right thing
Break it off and say goodbye
'Til she overheard him one night tellin'
Somebody on the side that

She wasn't good enough for him
For his family or his friends
He kept her out there on a limb
Wouldn't let her go wouldn't let her in
She wasn't good enough for him

She was good at late night listening
When he'd call her on the phone

There's something out there left for you
But it's not me
We've reached a point of no return
It's only right I set you free

I know I'll have to turn away
But there's nowhere for my love to go
And there won't come a day
When I won't honor what we've vowed

But I'll go on with my life
We can even say goodbye for now if
If that's what we have to do
But here in my heart
Even when my arms are empty darlin'
I'm still holdin' on to you

We can't deny that this one's
Out of our control
Stronger than the both of us
And bound to take its toll

I can stand the test of time
And as far as I can see
There are no walls that we can't climb
Standin' between you and me

But I'll go on with my life
We can even say goodbye for now if
If that's what we have to do
But here in my heart
Even when my arms are empty darlin'
I'm still holdin' on to you

And there's a place you'll always be
No matter where you are
You're here with me
When the world is turning upside down
Together we can stand our ground

We can even say goodbye for now if
If that's what we have to do
But here in my heart
Even when my arms are empty darlin'
I'm still holdin' on to you

I'm still holdin' on to you
When I'm gone
When I'm gone
I'm holdin' on

I see you waiting in the shadows
Wonderin' where I've been
Dusty old piano it's you and me again
My old friend
I'll just have to chance a few lines
Now that we're alone
All that happiness those silly rhymes
They just don't seem at home now that he's gone

So make it sad so sad
Like Faded Love or Born To Lose
Cause it's sad when a love song sings the blues

I see my reflection on the black keys
Where the tears fell from my eyes
I wanna play out every memory
Every last goodbye
Till the whole world cries

So make it sad so sad
Like Faded Love or Born To Lose
Cause it's sad when a love song sings the blues
And I don't want to cry alone

Make it sad so sad
Like Faded Love or Born To Lose
Cause it's sad when a love song sings the blues
And it's sad when a love song sings the blues

I thought I had my life worked out
I thought I knew what it was all about
Then love started talkin'
Your love started talkin'

I had my mind on the open road
I thought I knew where I wanted to go
Then love started talkin'
Your love started talkin'



When love starts talkin'
You got no choice
But to shut up and listen
It's a powerful voice
Open the door
And let it walk in
That's what you gotta do
When love starts talkin'

I thought I had it wrapped up neat and nice
I didn't need nobody's advice
Then love started talkin'
Your love started talkin'



I thought I heard it all before
I thought I didn't need to hear no more
Then love started talkin'
Your love started talkin'
Your love started talkin'
Your love started talkin'
Your love started talkin'
Love started talkin'

HmSilly Girl

Tried to write you a love song
In the middle of the night
Everything rhymed but it didn't feel quite right
Anway that's all we need
Is another modern day Shakespere
All I know is I get chills
Whever you're standing there

You're so cool
Cool as ice cream in the summertime
Cool as James Dean with a twist of lime
You're so fine and I dig you hard
They wouldn't print it in a Hallmark card
It's so high school
Yeah You're so cool

I don't know what's happening but it's a silly thing
I wanna wear your sweater
I wanna wear your ring

Ain't it funny what love
Can make a grown woman do
I've been telling my friend
I gotta big crush on you

You're so cool
Cool as Dylan back in '69
Cool as James Dean with a twist of lime
You're so fine and I dig you hard
Lovesick dreaming in the backyard
They wouldn't print it in a Hallmark card
It's so high school
Yeah You're so cool

It sounds so ordinary yeah
In my vocabulary
So I might as well say you roar

Been caught in a downpour of a rain of stones
Felt like an exile in the world I had known
So I sought the shelter of my own soul
And stayed inside

I found no comfort in placing blame
I saw the hope that lay just beyond the pain
The past is a prison and I won't wear those chains
And I won't hide oh no


I will be here
I will be strong
I'll face my fears 
When the night is long
And still go on
I will be brave
I will be bold
Follow my faith
To a higher road
And I'm not there yet
But I will be

I could choose to keep my feet upon the beaten path
Never cross the open field for the one snake in the grass
But I'd rather risk my heart then never get the chance
To find my way to find my way



Who keeps on trusting you
When you been cheating
Spending your nights on the town
Who keeps on saying
That she still wants you
When you're through runnin' around
Who keeps on lovin' you
When you been lyin'
Sayin' things that ain't what they seem
Well God does
But I don't
God will
But I won't
And that's the difference
Between God and me

God does but I don't
God will but I won't
And that's the difference
Between God and me

So who says she'll forgive you
Says that she'll miss you
And dream of your sweet memory
Well God does
But I don't
God will
But I won't
And that's the difference
Between God and me

God does but I don't
God will but I won't
And that's the difference
Between God and me

God does but I don't
God will but I won't
And that's the difference
Between God and me

I hear you calling my name
The sweet sounds of yesterday
When there was love and I was in it
Oh but seeing you this way
I hear the words I didn’t say
I see it way too late

There was a time I used to hold you
I should have told you
There was a time
I see your face and it reminds me
There was a place
There was - there was a time

We’re here and all I can think of is the way we used to be
How could I take for granted
The chance you took on me
You with your heart out on your sleeve
The heart that I still need

There was a time I used to hold you
I should have told you
There was a time
I see your face and it reminds me
There was a place
There was - there was a time

They say time changes everything
Time never stays the same
So tell me why do I still feel this way

There was a time I used to hold you
I should have told you
There was a time
I see your face and it reminds me
There was a place
There was - there was a time

How do I get through one night without you
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be
Oh and I I need you in my arms
Need you to hold
You're my world my heart my soul
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything good in my life

Without you there'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me
And I baby I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything real in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I
Oh how do I live

If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything
Need you with me
Baby 'cause you know that you're everything good in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever ever survive
How do I how do I
Oh how do I live
How do I live
Without you baby

They tried their best to drag him out
Of a courthouse down in Montgomery
And now they wanna kick him out of school
And take him off our money
They can take those words off of paper and stone
But he ain’t gone no


He ain’t the leavin’ kind
He’d never walk away
Even from those who don’t believe
And wanna leave him behind
He ain’t the leavin’ kind

She stayed mad at him for a lot of years
For takin’ her husband
Started losin’ her faith
And thinkin’ that her life meant nothin’
But when she looks at those kids she raised all by herself
She knows she had some help yeah she knows



No matter what you do
No matter where you go
He’s always right there with you

Even from those who don’t believe
And wanna leave him behind
He ain’t the leavin’ kind

No no
He ain’t the leavin’ he ain’t the leavin’ kind
He ain’t the leavin’ kind
He ain’t the leavin’ kind
